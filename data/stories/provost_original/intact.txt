"Come on! It's starting!" Greg, my neighbor, hollered from the sidewalk.
"What's starting?" I said.
Behind him, groups of kids hurried down the street.
We'd moved to the neighborhood just weeks before.
I was shy; a bookworm, waiting for school to start.
Greg was the only kid I'd met.
"The magic show!" said Greg, exasperated. "At Mr. Hale's house!"
At the end of the Hales' dirt driveway, rows of kids were seated on the grass.
White-haired and very thin, Mr. Hale wore a black top-hat and tails.
In his hand he gripped a wand, producing doves from an urn.
He asked for a volunteer to be sawed in half.
I raised my hand.
No one breathed.
"Just relax," Mr. Hale whispered. "There's nothing to it."
I got into the box and held my breath.
A collective gasp went up.
And when I emerged in one piece, I was a star.
