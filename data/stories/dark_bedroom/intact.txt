The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs.
Six years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim.
I bought a replacement bulb. But when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up.
So I realized the unit was bad. But I didn't really want to replace it.
Since then, my wife and I have had to live in darkness.
At night we use bedside lamps and bathroom lights.
I also keep some flashlights in the bedroom for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc.
This winter I decided I would replace the damn thing.
But before, I tried one last time with another bulb.
So I’m up there installing the new bulb.
I grab the remote.
(the fan has a remote)
And as I’m turning the light on I realize:
the goddamn thing is dimmable.
For six fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”.
