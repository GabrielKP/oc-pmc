This is exactly why I'm trying to read a lot less news and just focus more on my life. But word association is a lot of fun, I wouldn't mind doing more of that. I just tie anything into it that's somewhat relatable. For example, eagle, falcon, they eat small game, but I thought of worms, nutrition, so I just kept rolling with it.

I've long suspected that if you're focusing on something else, or multiple tasks, your critical brain function slows down as you're working with limited capacity. It's like trying to read a technical document at work when you're tired or on low sleep, your brain just doesn't register it the same way, and you might need to reread a few times to memorize it or even understand it well enough.   When we are distracted, it's similar to like being low sleep, in my opinion. I feel like things that grab our attention, our distractions, are usurping away the limited brain function we have. The limited amount of brain ""energy"" we have for that day, you know, it's a limited resource. Anyway, to tie it back with the study, definitely noticed a change after reading the story and doing the word game again. Which is ironic actually, because usually the second time you'd do a game it would become a lot easier.   Thanks again for the study. That was interesting.
