I was more focused the first time  since I was just thinking about the game and not processing the stories. I also think some of the words I used were what thought about the two stories. ,For first time I started thinking about words that had y as vowel when I ran out of those I thought more about groups of words. For example foods so words that are foods. The second time was more words relate to the stories and thought about but also groups of words. Also some random words that thought about at the moment.,sound,meaning,I think the experiment is trying to measure our ability to focus on task and just on that. How much or mind wonders/ losses focus or how can games help us make traumatizing stories less traumatizing. ,N,5.0,7.0,both,I feel like since the story relate to me intentionally reflected on it and unintentionally. I think linger so much because my cousin was murder so thinking how can people just do nothing and just pretend it happen until it suits them while I was playing the word game but I also thought Stuart and how in way felt bad for him. I did try to concentrate not think on the story when playing but it was hard. ,7.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,I felt empathy for the wife and even Stuart. I felt the feeling that the grieving family was feeling (sadness and anger). I felt paranoid when Clare was being followed. I also felt unsatisfied since I didn't see ending of the story. I felt a range of emotions.,7.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,47.0,54.0,35.0,0.5595238095238095,0.5934065934065934,0.5,It was fine. I like that the story was lighthearted and funny king of like plate cleanser for the first story.,N,7,3.0,story-start,both,I think I did reflect on it but not as much as the first story. I just think I used words that relate to in game.,USA,13:00,20-24,F,Right,N,Spanish,Y,,MORE,1,Y,2,10,N,,7.0,,I think it was kind of weird experiment but I enjoyed it. It made me reflect on things and also showed how much remember of story just after I have read it.
