The birds are chirping outside and the dog barked. I just tried to come up with random words that would not form a sentence, which was challenging. The second game was more difficult because of the words from the story that stuck in my mind. By then, a lawn mower had begun outside, which made plenty of noise that I could not ""turn off"" or affect in any way. I also tried very hard to think of words that might not have occurred in the story, and I began thinking of music for the second game. Since I'm sort of a word nut, the idea that the words were not supposed to make sentences affected my thinking. As soon as I wanted to connect the word to the next, I tried to shift to another subject. I did not use the strategies listed in the following two questions because I tried to focus on a subject such as music, which created a mental image in my mind of people performing on a stage. When that subject became empty, I was still thinking of the story, so wanted to choose words that were not involved, if possible because I did not want to let it influence my thinking. ",none,none,"The triangle counting after the story was confusing because I was still processing the story and my thoughts about what I'd read. I was also trying to figure out why the story was incredibly familiar to me, which made the triangle-counting experience annoying in a sense. My thoughts were not on the triangles because they were still in the story, which made trying to concentrate on them very difficult. I also figured I did not count them right at that point. Basically, I did not want to concentrate on the triangles and preferred to think about the story. ","The experiment could be trying to measure how much recall a person has after their thoughts have been interrupted by an exercise in counting triangles. The study also might be testing to see if the vocabulary given in the story appeared prominently in the word chain game. I think if that were the case, the words would have contained whiskey, body, and words like water, or river--all words that occurred during the story, as opposed to what might randomly come from one's thoughts if not influenced by what they read. The experiment could also be testing how much recall a person has when they are reading and how vividly the story appears in their imagination. I think Carver's style of writing allows for the reader to create vivid pictures in their minds, which made him superlative at his craft. At least his work always has that effect on me when reading his stories.","I had less trouble with the first word-chain game the first time because I had nothing in my mind except the overarching task of mowing that was looming for later today. I could randomly come up with words, such as animals and relate a few of them together. After reading the story, I only tried not to be influenced by the repetitive words from what I had read. The story felt vivid enough to me that the words used in the descriptions were too fresh to concentrate fully on the word chain as well, but I tried to use that as a challenge. I attempted to think of words that were not related to the story, but I'm not certain that I succeeded in doing so. I was preoccupied with the story while doing the second word-chain game.",7,intentional,"The story is still lingering in my mind and it will continue to do so throughout the day. I wanted to savor the story more and think about what had happened to the characters. I was concerned for Claire because of Stuart's personality. I don't think I'm able to read a story without intentionally reflecting afterward because I'm an avid reader or addicted reader. The word-chain game after the story was more difficult just like the counting of triangles because they both interfered with my desire to think about what I'd just read. If the story had been a run-of-the-mill piece that did not require thought, perhaps the outcome would be different, but Carver's works evoke the need for much thought to parse the different themes he created within a story. I'm much more affected by what I read and the place where I picture what is going on in my imagination makes reading much more effective and important than watching images on a screen. I'm only writing that in the attempt to explain why the story had such an effect on my thoughts.

Whiskey was not one of the answers and it was mentioned much more often--in my opinion--than ""beer,"" which was the only option closest to what might be right. Claire and Stuart did go to town to get beer, but most every description of Stuart previous to that point, and after that point included whiskey. The men also went on their fishing trip with whiskey. I felt like the question could have been worded differently because I found it problematic. The other question about what happened to Claire on the way to the funeral offered answers that were also ambiguous. The truck did follow her, but the encounter with the man stuck out much more prominently than when she was followed, which was how the experience began. The question was not wrong, but the wording made me question the answers. The only question I was uncertain of was what the men did after Stuart called the sheriff because I thought they agreed to wait then until people arrived to take their statements. I don't think there was an option in that question that matched what I recalled, but maybe I missed the answer there. Thank you for telling who the author was because I was affected while reading the story. I focused on Carver's writing when I was working on my MFA and his style is not like any other writer I can think of. Specifically, the way he mentions women's body parts in the story, such as when the man in the truck returned to check out Claire when she had her windows rolled up is one characteristic of his work. That same aspect occurred at the end of the story where the reader was left to imagine what the ending might have been. There were other instances where Carver used the mention of legs or actions that were what I think of as his ""calling cards,"" but they were of a specific time period, which makes them even more outstanding of his work. Thank you for letting me take part in the study and more importantly sending me off to reread more of Carver's work this afternoon! Also, I was concerned when reading about how many details you might want me to recall after reading, which meant I was reading much more carefully because there were so many details mentioned. I was worried about whether I'd have to recall the woman's limp outside the funeral home, or the woman in the print dress who gave her little girl a red licorice stick. I was concerned because I'm never certain to what degree the questions might be ones to check about whether I was paying attention.
