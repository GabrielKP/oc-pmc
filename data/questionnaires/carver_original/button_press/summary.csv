I figured I'd probably be asked questions about the story, so I was also trying to remember what details I could while playing the word game. I guess I was more distracted from the actual game itself the second time, even though I was typing whatever words came to mind. It was kind of autopilot v. actively thinking about the words. I'm a terrible speller, and I also worried less about that as I typed. At first I was like, ""What will these researchers think of me when they see I can't spell potato?"" The second time around I thought, ""That's close enough that they'll know what I mean, and it's not like they can find my fifth grade teacher and report on how horribly she failed."" I also thought a lot about the story itself and whether or not it was written by AI or an actual author. At first I thought AI but changed my mind as the story progressed. I thought about trying to find the story to read it as a whole. I hated pressing enter to get to the next sentence. I like seeing the sentences as part of a paragraph. I felt like I could get more into the story that way. So, I was thinking about all that during the second game.
