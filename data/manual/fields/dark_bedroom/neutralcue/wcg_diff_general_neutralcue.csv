1010,gave me more word ideas,
1011,"It felt much harder because I was trying not to repeat words, which made it harder because I had used most of the obvious ones the first time. I also used some of the words from the story the second time. ",

1016,it enhance my vocabulary and cretivity whiles the story inspired me,
1017,i felt the urge  to change the words,
1018,i felt normal,
1019,No particular difference except that I started with key words from the story.,
1020,"I wanted to use the words from the story, since they were fresh in my mind and some I had not thought of yet.",
1021,no difference,
1022,it felt easier and i think i reused words from the first time,
1023,Started focused on the story for round 2,

1025,wanted to use words from the story,
1026,exposed to more words after reading the story,
1027,I felt like it was easier to think of words after reading the story because I was focused on what the words were saying and the imagery the story was generating for me. Before I felt like I was grasping at straws and making things up.,

1034,"After reading the story, most of the words i came up with were either directly from the story, or closely related to words from the story.",
1035,No differences,
1036,Only difference is that before I created a story but after I went the random route,
1037,"Before reading the story, playing the word chain game was more focused on maintaining a sequence of words without specific context. After reading the story, there was a heightened awareness of the importance of paying attention to details and avoiding assumptions, as highlighted by the oversight with the dimmable light bulb. This led to a more strategic approach in selecting words that could relate to everyday situations and potential oversights, enhancing the depth and relevance of the game.",
1038,It was easier to start the word chain game after reading the story because I had a topic to go off of. ,
1039,The story seemingly began my second set of word choices because the ideas form the story were still in mind.,
1040,"I attempted to use longer words and try not to have them completely associate with the other words used,",
1041,"It felt the same to me both times, essentially.",
1042,I got so many ideas to write more words ,
1043,"I was still laughing from the story when starting the second round, so I was in a better mood.",
1044,A difference I felt playing the second word game was my first word choices had to do with lightness and things I remembered from the story,

1048,I had a theme to go off of and it changed my direction of thinking,
1049,I did not feel any difference.,
1050,normal,

1057,no difference ,
1058,I used some of the words on the story in the second word game.,
1059,"Like I said, before I was just coming up with random words and writing them down with no rhyme or reason. After the story I wanted to stick with the vibe I thought the story was going to go with (I thought it was going to be a scary story) until it got harder to come up with words so then I went back to my original approach of writing down words as they came to mind.",
1060,I had more ideas for words.,
1061,none,
1062,i felt like the second round made me want to tell a story more than the first round.,
1063,nothing,

1069,"I felt like i had more words to choose from that weren't previously on my mind, after reading the story.",
1070,I felt that it was harder to come up with words because I had already exhausted most of my immediate surroundings that I was using to start word chains.,
1071,"It didn't feel particularly different, but I think I may have been unknowingly remembering the words from the story. I do remember thinking of light and a couple. ",
1072,I felt no difference,
1073,slightly easier the second time after chuckling at the silly story ,
1074,"I don't think I felt differently at all. The first words I came up with in the second chain definitely arose from the story, but I didn't feel much emotion during either word chain game. I found it sort of fun to associate words, so I enjoyed the game, but I don't think my mood was markedly different during the second chain. ",
1075,just started looking around the room to see what I could bring up that was similar to each other to keep it all going ,
1076,"Before I just had random words in mind, but after reading the story I remembered words from the story and I used most of them.",

1080,it was the same for me ,
