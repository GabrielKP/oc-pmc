1005,"I didn't notice any difference other than I took the word play as a challenge, though I was confused in the first round but I was able to do better in the second round.",
1006,I felt like i got the general idea of the study a little more after the story ,
1007,,

1009,no changes specifically ,
1010,no specific changes at all,
1011,I just felt some frustration trying to come up with new words. No major change in emotion or experience. ,
1012,The only change was realizing the introduction of the story that may influence the second word game.,
1013,I felt more annoyed than before reading the story. I was reminded of a time that something similar happened to me.,
1014,i love the survey ,
1015,"There wasn't any specific changes beyond the decision to use the story as a way to start off the second word chain game, because it allowed me to have something to use as reference.",
1016,inspiring,
1017,i felt the urge to think about the story,
1018,it was stressful but as time went on the words came by itself,
1019,"The story made me chuckle and I felt more at ease. The second time I played the ""word game"" I was more relaxed and had a more positive attitude.",
1020,"I was trying not to repeat words from the first round, but that was difficult. I also didn't want to just copy the stories words, I still wanted to come up with my own.",
1021,The story was funny so my emotions were more happy after reading it ,
1022,I just felt like it was easier the second time because I had already thought of words and was thinking of the words in the story,
1023,"I didn't really feel any changes, I was pretty locked in to the word game.",
1024,"The only real change that I noticed was that my focus in the second word chain game was on the story at the start. As additional associations were made, my thoughts clearly diverged from the story. While related to the story, it was easy to come up with additional words. Once my thoughts diverged, there were more gaps where a word didn't immediately come to mind.",
1025,i visualized the words from the story,
1026,A change in the topic that came to mind because reading the story brought more words to mind,
1027,I wasn't bored by the game as I'm used to playing with words. But I did feel a lot more relaxed after the story since it had a humorous conclusion and it's a relatable experience. I felt at ease trying to come up with more words even if they had no connections to each other.,
1028,after reading the story i was now easy for me to come up with new words.,
1029,"I FELT I WAS GOING TO FORM MY OWN STORY, EITHER RELATED TO THE FORMER OR NOT.",
1030,"In the first game, I felt like my choices were really random. In the second game, I had some word ideas to play off of. By the end of the game I felt lost again.",
1031,The experience was great ,
1032,I was not bored reading the story. I was highly amused and found it funny ,
1033,"For some reason it was more difficult to come up with words after reading the story, maybe because it was more interesting or perhaps because I was subconsciously still thinking about it. ",
1034,There was no other changes asides the one already mentioned,
1035,I felt no significant changes.,
1036,The experience felt pretty straightforward. I enjoyed the word chaining game. I didn't feel any specific change outside of the changing the strategy of putting together a story before hand and then going random the second time.,
1037,"Reading the story about the dimmable light bulb highlighted the impact of small oversights on daily life, prompting greater awareness of attention to detail. This awareness influenced my approach to activities like playing the word chain game, where I became more mindful of selecting words that related to practical scenarios and considering the broader implications of oversight.",
1038,"I did feel like the second word game was easier because I had an interesting story in my mind to give me a starting topic. The first game, I felt thrown in with little to no instruction and felt I had to be creative. It was harder to start the first game than the second so anxiety was a bit higher the first time around.",
1039,I felt like I had rerun the story in my mind and that I should move on. I was not particularly glad or sad about running out of words from the story. I did slow down in transitioning to new words not associated with the story.,
1040, I started to use words associated with the story.,
1041,"I did not experienced any real changes between reading the story and playing the second round of the game. Since I had already played one round of the game, I felt I was able to return to it with the same approach as the first time. This allowed me to get back to my original task without the story entering my mind at all.",
1042,"There was no changes in my emotions, i was totally attentive and into the study",
1043,I was definitely in a sillier mood after reading the story and it affected my word choices.,
1044,I felt it was easier in the beginning of the second word game to come up with words since the story was fresh in my mind. It did not make me any more tired or bored though,
1045,I felt that after reading the story I came up with words very quickly and that were more diverse than the first round,
1046,exciting,
1047,"The main change I felt is that I went into the second word chain game annoyed. In the beginning, I thought about the fact that something so simple could have been easily fixed within seconds. That left me with a feeling of annoyance and agitation towards the main character.",
1048,I felt a little more tired from the word game due to a lack of timer so I had no idea if I was stuck or not but it was enjoyable otherwise,
1049,,
1050,Normal,
1051,"While I was playing the word chain game for a second time, I noticed I reflected more on the story at the beginning but as I kept playing the game, I thought less and less about the story I had read and forgot some key details from the story.",
1052,It was harder not to use the same words from prior. So my mind went slightly blank a few times and I felt a little lost while thinking of new words or whatever came up    ,
1053,I felt happy after reading it,
1054,"I had the story in the back of my mind, but I didn't relate it to the word chain game.  I don't know why.  I think I didn't feel I could get enough words out of it to fil three minutes",
1055,I felt changes in my mood as I played the second word game.,
1056,I cannot relate to any specific changes other than the fact that the story might of affected my choice of words.,
1057,I did no feel much difference.,
1058,I kept replying the scenario in my mind.,
1059,First round I was just having fun with no rules when it came to the word chain game. The second round I wanted to challenge myself to stick to a theme (and I manage to for the most part) until it got too hard to stick to it (especially since I wanted to keep my word count up for second round compared to first).,
1060,I found it easier to come up with words.,
1061,"again i did not feel any changes really, i was just trying to go blank and let them come to me. if i did feel any difficulty i tried to put it out of mind and let it go blank again",
1062,playing the first round and second round felt about the same. i picked a random word and thought of life associations or a rhyming word. mostly I focused on opposites. ,
1063,nothing,
1064,I remembered key words and themes from the story while playing the game the second time. This was different than the first time because I did not have an established theme or story to draw from initially.,
1065,I just felt humor cause i know exactly how ticked off the person in the story was cause i have been there before.,
1066,it was a very fun task i felt like i was having fun playing a game ,
1067,My mind seemed to be a little more clear and I was able to think of more words at a faster pace.,
1068,"I did not have to think hard to come up with the words, as the words from the story came to mind easily. Therefore, the game felt easier.",
1069,"I didn't feel as much that I was pulling words out of my hat-mind, so much in the second game than I did in the first round. I had a vivd story I just read, so those images were still fresh in my mind, and came to me first.",
1070,"Like I said in my previous response, I found it more difficult to focus on coming up with a word to use. I think I started with lights and dim, but after a bit I was drawing blanks. I think the story may have lingered in my mind and distracted me a bit, but I wouldn't say I was tired or bored due to the story.",
1071,"I found the story funny so that lightened my mood and I think made it easier to actively engage with thinking of words. I didn't notice the word game being easier, it felt about the same in terms of ease of thinking up words. I wasn't bored either round as it was interesting seeing what word I'd think up next and the game itself was engaging. ",
1072,"I did not feel ay changes. I took it as separate, unrelated tasks basically. ",
1073,slightly more at ease and less competitive about the word challenge,
1074,"I truly did not experience notable changes. The two chains just felt like discrete instances of the same activity. I expect I would feel the same now if I were to do a third chain. I tried not to overthink it and to allow it to happen naturally, and I would do the same again.",
1075,Was just trying to pass the time. The last minute was very boring and hard to come up with words. ,
1076,It was a good experience and took a bit of stress off me,
1077,,
1078,"I did feel a little more anxious, a little more agitated, I felt like I'm being rushed more. I also felt like the pauses of empty thinking, empty thoughts, etc. were longer because I could notice a difference in the length of my pauses alone. I'm not sure how much it affected me though, but it did for sure. This is a very interesting study that I haven't really encountered a similar one to. Thank you for the study. ",
1079,I think that the retention of the story was somewhere in the back of my mind. This may have made it more difficult to make word associations during the second round.,
1080,i noticed the game was harder when you have to remember the story ,
1081,"I felt like in the second half I could come up with more words more easily by coming up with as many words as I could pertaining to a certain topic. In the first half, I basically just let my mind come up with random, less related words for the most part and that caused me to struggle a bit more. I also believe it was easier in the second half due to being able to come up with a lot of words based on the reading.",
