1037,"I focused on words that had common ending like ""e"", ""n"", and ""t"" which provided more options for the next word, making it easier to continue the chain. I also used everyday common words.",
1038,I was thinking about relevant things happening in my life. We recently bought a home so I was almost summing up our experiences in a few keywords. I was also just letting my mind wander and writing out the first things that came to my head.,

1059,"Before the story I was going with whatever words the came to mind, but with no real theme. After the story I did the same thing, but with the impression the story gave me, but that started falling apart after a while so I just went back to writing down random words that came to mind.",
1060,Stream of consciousness effected by my surroundings.,
1061,just letting my mind go blank and letting the words come,
1062,"opposites, relevant words, things in my life",

1070,I tried to think of other words that were related to the last word or perhaps used similar letters. I also looked around my room to get inspiration to start a different word chain.,

1072,I tried to think of the show that used to be on air about word chains,
1073,"things are me, random categories",
1074,"I basically just free associated and typed the first thing that came through my head. I tried not to think much about it and generally left less than a second between words, if possible. If I misspelled something, I attempted to correct the spelling. Occasionally, I hit a certain topic and it became a bit of a list that I went through. And I definitely started the second word chain with words that resonated from the story.",

1078,"I try not to think too long as thinking too much makes you stumble and blank out, so I just associate the first or second thing that pops into my mind, and I've been reading the news a lot the past week so I'm sure there's quite an amount of some sad, anxious, kinda depressing themes. This is exactly why I'm trying to read a lot less news and just focus more on my life. But word association is a lot of fun, I wouldn't mind doing more of that. I just tie anything into it that's somewhat relatable. For example, eagle, falcon, they eat small game, but I thought of worms, nutrition, so I just kept rolling with it. ",
