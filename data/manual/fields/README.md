### no_strategy

Participants did not engage in any explicit procedure such as looking at surroundings or indicitated just doing association.

Examples:

- I was just naming what happened to come to mind. I also avoided what was asked of us during these sections of the study so I kept those rules in the back of my mind.
- I tried to keep my thinking very close to the word at hand so that I wouldn't stray close the the subjects I was told to avoid.
- I wrote whatever popped in my head and thought of relating words.\
- No strategies
- none

Participants that thought about categories of words.

Examples:

- I typed in groups of related words, one word each time.
- 1st time, avoid food 2nd time, concentrate on the letter c
- categories were helpful,

**Prompt to participants**: "Please describe any differences you felt playing the word chain game before versus after reading the story."

**Participants can have multiple tags.**

### concentrate

Participants reported focusing (concentrating) on a certain aspect of the second half of the study.

- I was more alert of the words I was picking after reading the text.
- The only difference was trying not to think about certain things described in the instruction.

### easier

Participants reported it was easier to generate words after reading the story.

- The second one felt way easier, there was less to think about.
- I just had something different to NOT focus on. I was able to type food words the second time which made it easier.

### lingering

- I was still thinking about the story during rd 2 of the word chain.
- It was hard to not think about the story, I wanted to know what happens next.
