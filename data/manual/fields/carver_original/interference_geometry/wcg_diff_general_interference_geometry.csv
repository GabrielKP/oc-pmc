1506,"I was less enthusiastic about playing the word chain game after reading the story, not because of the story but because it was the second time doing the game. I wasn't sure that you could use words from the first word chain game in the second word chain game. Also, it seemed to be a long time doing the game, and I started running out of potential words to write.",
1507,"I fel that my mind dwelled on the story after reading it, so I had words related to the story come up in the word chain. I also felt tense due to the content of the story ",

1509,"After reading the story, a lot of the words related to what I read.",
1510,Before reading the story I felt like I needed to think of a lot of different words and did not try to pull words together. After reading I was feeling like I could create more connections between words to create new words.,

1526,my second round I added words that were related to the story.,
1527,"The story was fresh in my mind so I used words from things that were in the story. When I couldn't think of any more words from the story, I reverted back to random thoughts and objects from my surroundings.",

1531,I was more focused on trying not to repeat words that I used the first time.,
1532,"Seeing that it was after already reading the start of a story that had a darker theme to it, going into a word chain game in the middle of it when things were being hinted at slowly threw me off a loop for a moment. Because of that, the time it took to think of words was slightly more longer than the first round since my head was split between the story and finishing the game with enough words in time.",

1548,There wasn't a difference.,
1549,The story really didn't make any difference in the way I play the word chain game. I was trying to focus on not repeating words from the first game. ,
1550,no comment,
1551,"After reading the story, I was still trying to recall the story while I was playing the game, as I was 99% sure that there would be questions asked about the story after I was finished playing the game. My associative words became more vague, I feel, after reading the story.",

1566,it was an easy challenge ,
1567,"I had less trouble with the first word-chain game the first time because I had nothing in my mind except the overarching task of mowing that was looming for later today. I could randomly come up with words, such as animals and relate a few of them together. After reading the story, I only tried not to be influenced by the repetitive words from what I had read. The story felt vivid enough to me that the words used in the descriptions were too fresh to concentrate fully on the word chain as well, but I tried to use that as a challenge. I attempted to think of words that were not related to the story, but I'm not certain that I succeeded in doing so. I was preoccupied with the story while doing the second word-chain game.",
1568,the time feels longer and I got tired early,
1569,I had to switch between being so emotional and solving the mathematical problems,

1587,I used some words from the story the second time I did the word chain game.,

1596,I doubted myself playing the word chain game the second time because I thought the words I was thinking of were too weird or violent so I hesitated more before entering words.,
1597,"I felt that after I had read the story I had more words fresh in my mind that I could use for the word chain game, especially words that I don't frequently or haven't used in a long time, such as blouse. But I also wanted to stray away from just listing off the stories words because I thought I would get too caught up in doing that and submit less words overall as a result.",
1598,After I felt like I wanted to use words from the story but that I shouldn't.,
1599,Before i was like this is a fun task i just get to list words and bable and after i was like oh. yeah  i forgot about this bit that story was pretty good or well i liked it and i haven't read much lately. ,
1600,The story was sad and I was a little bit down during the word because I felt emotions,

1611,,
1612,i didnt feel too different but i did get some of my words from the short story.,
1613,"I do not think I had any differences between the word chain games. I think this happened because I was using word association both times to create my chains, and the story did not affect my word association.",
1614,I didn't feel any differences.,
1615,"I used the same method as the first time, but I couldn't stop thinking about the story.",

1617,none,
1618,I felt no different at all.,
1619,I didn't notice any differences.,
1620,My word chain clearly started with words that had to do with the story. I believe my first word was murder or something along those lines which was a prominent part of the story. The story clearly was on my mind as I was thinking of words early on. ,
1621,"During the second round, I felt more saddened and troubled by the story, so a few of my words may have been more macabre or based on unfortunate events in life. The first round was simply filled with words that came to mind.",

1631,"Before, I mostly focused on just keeping words coming without having huge gaps of time in between words.  After the story, I was slightly less worried about coming up with words.  Initially, I just started doing words from the story, and then that branched off.",
