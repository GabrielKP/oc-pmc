1505,"I didn't feel like I felt any specific changes. If anything, maybe my mood was a little darker, but I didn't feel like ti affected me in playing the word chain game",
1506,"I felt I was needing to continue to think of words for the second word chain game, despite the increasing difficulty. I might have thought slightly about the story at the start, but once I was doing the word chain I didn't think of the story at all, just what could I think of for the next word.",
1507,"I felt more tense internally, and I feel that the tension came from the story. I felt more scattered, and it felt like I was jumping from category to category during the word chain game. ",
1508,"I think I thought more on a broader spectrum of words, such as emotions or types of people or concepts, other than just tangible objects like I did on the first round of the game. ",
1509,"During the second round of the word chain game I was definitely more sad. I was also still focused on the story, so a lot of the words involved events from the story.",
1510,"I didn't really feel any changes. I disassociated the tasks and did not think one was relevant to the other. The words I chose were, as far as I remember, unrelated to the story.",
1511,I think I was more focused on the specific story than a broader topic. ,
1512,I didnt feel any change.  The task changed so I was focused on the new task.,
1513,"As stated previously, the words seemed to come to me easier the second time around.  I also didn't realize until I answered the question above that, yes, it was less boring to do the word chain game the second time around.",
1514,I wanted to know more about the story but aside from that I didn't really have any different feelings.,
1515,I was mostly interested in the story and found it intriguing.,
1516,I was trying to concentrate on the words,
1517,I was intrigued and wanted to read more of the story. It was something that kept my attention and left me wanting to read more of it instead of doing other things like the word game.,
1518,I already felt sad but the story made it much worse. I was also feeling puzzled. It is hard to tie the story events together when they are presented one sentence at a time. Some sentences were continuations of quotes but missing the quotation marks on the page displayed so it was jarring trying to figure out whether they were spoken words. The story was disturbing.,
1519,"I felt like it was a little easier for me to come up with words, since reading was like almost exercise for me and made my brain work more.",
1520,"I felt no changes, just able to produce more words during the second chain game.",
1521,"The words came a little bit easier, which perhaps made it seem a little less boring/ the time went by quicker.",
1522,I thought the story really changed my mood from the start of the study which I thought was going to be more fun.,
1523,I felt the tasks get equally easier but harder after reading the story.,
1524,It was easier to recall words but harder to spell,
1525,I felt like there was not change in how I felt.,
1526,the second round was much easier. I felt like my imagination was sparked and I could think of many more words easily.,
1527,I felt I could easily come up with words while playing the word chain game after the story because the emotions in the story were strong enough to cross over into my own emotions. I could imagine how the characters were feeling. ,
1528,i didn't feel any different from this study,
1529,"I felt more curious about the story, not really wanting it to end, but then, I wished I could read it in 'passage-form' than in single lines.",
1530,Depressed,
1531,Knowing what to expect the second time around I was more focused on the game so it wasn't as stressful to come up with words. Maybe it's because I have aphantasia but it truly is very easy to separate experiences in my head and not let them influence the other. At least not consciously. ,
1532,"Fatigue was the most notable change when doing it. With the way the story presentation was set up by short sentence by short sentence instead of all at once, somehow it felt just as arduous than if the whole thing was displayed at once despite the fact this method was supposed to make the reading easier. Because of this once it got time to the second round, I felt the physical fatigue specifically in my eyes and wanting to just close them before diving back in. ",
1533,"a change of concentration to the reflection of the story,a change to think deep while finding finds to describe the current feelings displayed",
1534,I often switched emotions while playing the game from trying to read the story and deal with the emotions as well as solving the arithmetic problems,
1535,i felt sad ,
1536,it was a very pleasant experience ,
1537,I felt tired of reading the story,
1538,I experienced little to know changes.,
1539,,
1540,I was more concentrated on the story instead of focusing on the word chain game. The story captivated me and it played on in my head during the game.,
1541,,
1542,I felt like it was easier to come up with words the second time.  Perhaps it had a little to do with reading the story but I think it was more so me understanding the game more the second time around as far as not using the words to form a sentence. ,
1543,"I was only trying to avoid words I had used previously, not thinking back to the story at all.",
1544,"I felt that it was easier to do the second time. I felt bored by the end and guilty that I kept repeating the same words. I felt more pressure the first time, and less the second as the words came more naturally.",
1545,The only specific change I felt was emotionally since it was an intense story. I started feeling a little tired and shocked by the story.,
1546,"Really any changes I felt were related to the writing of the story. I was confused due to some of the opening sentences not really making any sense, then a little irritated at the somewhat double standard writing of describing Stuart as a ""big strong man"" with ""big strong hands"" but calling the woman handing licorice to the little girl a ""fat woman"" instead of just ""a woman"". That type of writing instantly frustrates me and had a lasting effect through the entire reading of the story.",
1547,"The main difference is that the story was on my mind, and thinking of how it may have ended. That helped my think of words that I put down that did relate to the story. ",
1548,I truly didn't feel changes.,
1549,"The story was awful. I tend to veer away from such subjects, but I had to read it for this study. I got through it okay, but not something I would intentionally read on my own. The word games were just fine with me, no issues. ",
1550,It was interesting ,
1551,The primary change I felt was trying to concentrate on the story while simultaneously doing a good job of the word chain game.,
1552,I changed in using words that were in the passage for the second word chain.,
1553,"I was definitely less bored the second time around, as I was engaged in the story before playing. The first time playing the word game, I tried to avoid certain topics as to not get dark with the word associations. After reading the story, I avoided those words/topics less. ",
1554,I mostly noticed a change in topics that came to mind. I did not feel any changes in emotions I felt.,
1555,"I felt a lot more interested in the word game, the 3 minute timer felt a lot shorter. It was easier to come up with words in the beginning and then i started struggling a little because i was starting to think about the story again. The words i thought of became more negative and dark.",
1556,"it took me longer to get started with the word chain task. the story was a bit darker than expected, so i did carry some of that into subsequent tasks. i found myself less focused on the tasks after reading the story, but was eventually able to proceed. the triangle task was more difficult than the word chain (before and after the story), i felt like i just kind of gave up on trying to find additional triangles other than the obvious ones",
1557,I enjoyed the excerpt from the story and wanted to know more about what happened. I feel like it affected how I pictured words for the 2nd game play. ,
1558,I felt triggered by some details that led me to have post traumatic recall.,
1559,"After reading the story, I noticed a direct change in my emotions which had a huge impact on my second round of the word chain game. I almost felt like I was grieving this person. It gave me a pit in my stomach that still persists right now. Before reading the story, I felt my normal neutral emotions. The story has made me feel sadness and grief, and has also made me contemplative.",
1560,I felt like I wanted to keep reading and I wished I had more time or spent more time trying to get through the story. Very glad we found the name of it.,
1561,NO. Everything was done as per the instructions,
1562,I felt no change,
1563,it simply made it easier to think of random words for the experiment ,
1564,The way the story was written played with my sense of time and it really stoked my imagination.  I feel that this helped the words flow in the word chain game.  I was also slightly more distracted during the game so I may not have typed as many words as the first word game.,
1565,I didn't feel anything it felt like a different part of the survey,
1566,the time i was reading the story i felt emotional and during the time i was doing the word chain i was more happier ,
1567,"I felt a change after reading the story because random words were more difficult to come up with because I was still thinking about the story. I was not ""tired"" or ""bored"" when playing the word-chain game. If anything, I was motivated to find vocabulary that was not included in the story. My focus was still on the story, which made thinking of words more difficult.",
1568,the story was interesting but coming up with words was a bit difficut,
1569,I felt disturbed emotionally while reading the story,
1570,"I felt emotional, sad, depressed. I found it somewhat easier to come up with words since I had the story as a generak guideline.",
1571,"I just felt more tired and bored, to be honest.",
1572,"I felt more relaxed playing the word chain game cause the word came in easy. I was thinking about the story if Claire ever feel save around her husband again, f her husband ended up making amends to how he treated her. ",
1573,"I didn't feel any change once I put the story out of my mind, which was fairly easy to do since Carver stories are so understated to begin with.",
1574,"I really did not feel any specific changes in relation to the word game, however I did enjoy the story quite a bit, but I was able to put it aside to focus on the word game. ",
1575,I didn't like the chain game in the middle between reading the story because I wanted to continue reading the story.,
1576,I had words come to mind in the second word chain game that did not come to mind in the first game. This was directly related to the story. I had many words come to mind based on sections of the story and the themes presented.,
1577,During the first game I felt happier and thought of things in my life that were happy. While coming up with words n the second game my mind kept going back to the story and I had to push it out of my mind. ,
1578,"As mentioned previously, it was just a bit more difficult to stay focused with the story and its details in mind and naturally trying to think of what would happen next in the story.",
1579,"The story lingered in my mind but I still tried to think up original words, not just repeat them.",
1580,"I felt like I had more in my mind after reading the story. It was a combination of remembering what I read, and thinking of words for the word chain game.",
1581,like i said before i only felt a little tensed,
1582,i had a change of emotions while playing the word chain game because the story lingered on my mind,
1583,"at some point, I was more interested in how the story would turn out.",
1584,I felt calmer in playing word chain after the story,
1585,I felt like my mind was able to wander much more after reading the story. It was as if the story was like a warm up for my brain to think of descriptive words.,
1586,i was almost bored but then it ended and the word game started so i sat up and started typing again,
1587,I think I felt a bit sadder when doing the game the second time. This is likely because I just read about the murder.,
1588,i just was thinking of more morbid words. it put a negative spin on what i thought about the first time i did the word chain game. ,
1589,"after, i would have a rapid series of words and then my mind would blank for a moment then there would be more words. It was not that way the first time",
1590,I ended up putting more words related to bodies of water the the second game but I don't know if that was a direct result of reading the story,
1591,the longer i played the more outside influences started effecting me.  such as my cat jumping up on my desk.  that caused me to lose train of thought,
1592,By the second round of Word Chain I felt as if I was repeating words I used in the first round.,
1593,"I did not feel any particular change in emotion. This could also be because I did not see how the story ended, and it is usually easier to chuck out an unfinished story from the mind than a finished story.",
1594,,
1595,I thought this was an interesting experiment. I felt that I was less interested in doing the word chain game and counting triangles after I had already been reading the story. I was less focused on those tasks than I was on the passage I was reading. ,
1596,I felt that I started thinking of words with darker themes after reading the story.,
1597,I didn't experience much of a change other than perhaps being slightly easier since I had more words to choose from in recent memory instead of coming up with random words.,
1598,The story was interesting and slightly disturbing. I was drawn into the story and had a hard time re-focusing on the survey. ,
1599,Its like you know when you tense up if your reading something interesting and now you kinda wanna know whats next and part of me during the task was like oh wait i wanna know whats next even though it made me a bit upset cause like a girl was murdered thrown into the middle of the woods and our lens the wife clair's husband went to the most suspicous spot and the fact that she herself like had to deal with a past trauma of like somone getting murdered. it was wild. ,
1600,I think sad stories can make you feel bad in a good mood,
1601,,
1602,"I don't feel like there were many changes, I was more tired and board just from length. ",
1603,Just not being able to shake the fictional story board out of my head,
1604,"I began to think a little bit more about death after reading the passage. I also thought about the scenery of the passage, and it did impact the words that I included for the second word chain game. I did repeat some words from the first game, but there were also new words that I added for the second game. ",
1605,,
1606,"I felt like I had a better strategy of what words to type considering I was able to figure it out the first time, a good strategy of how to type as many words as I could.",
1607,I felt bored during the second word chain game cos i was reminiscing on the story.,
1608,"In the second round, I felt more confident about choosing words and they flowed quicker and easier. I was more invested the second time and not thinking about the time or wishing it would end. I did not notice how much time it was taking the second time around.",
1609,I've already described this in a previous answer. PLEASE do not ask us to type the same information OVER AND OVER for such little pay. I've already answered and now it's over 50 minutes! Please rethink how you are wasting time.,
1610,"I felt ill at ease and upset.  I worried about the narrator, Claire, and wondered what happened next.",
1611,,
1612,"i felt my experience was overall good, i had a clear image while reading the story, i found the story to be clearly well written. I didnt feel any mental changes during this experiment, i do however want to read what happens next.",
1613,"Ultimately, I was able to separate the gritty contents of the story and the words I picked for the chain game, so I feel that the story did not have an effect on me playing the game. However, I was still thinking about what I just read since the story was interesting to me.",
1614,I only felt a bit more bored because I felt I had no direction or specific goal in mind when in the word chain game.,
1615,"While I was playing the word game, my mind focused on that activity, but when I finished, I immediately thought about the story again.",
1616,i felt myself immersed in the story and my mind going back to it,
1617,I was fine. I was just trying my best to think of words. I tried to come up with all I could.,
1618,,
1619,I was shocked and invested in the story. I kept wishing I could read more as the word chain game went on.,
1620,"I think the only change I noticed was how I was still thinking about the story. I think that words still came to mind easily and that I had no apparent change in ability. That being said, the topics of the words changed due to me being so focused on the story at the moment. That felt like it dwindled later in the chain as I found different words to use coming off the top of my mind.",
1621,"I felt somewhat tricked by the word game because I went from fun to filled with foreboding. I enjoyed each activity, including the story; however, as it was probably intended, the story threw a wrench in the flow of the game. The words were easy to come by, but they felt almost out of place at times. My mind was still on the story.",
1622,The word chain game became much easier for me and I did not have as many pauses where I was thinking of words.,
1623,"There were a few seconds where it was a bit ""darker"" or ""heavier"" after the story, but mostly, there weren't any real differences.",
1624,"It was harder to come up with words after reading because they all felt so depressing. I also couldn't stop thinking of the story, so it was hard to not make sentences. The topics definitely changed after reading, the words I was thinking of were sad and depressing. I was bored the first time, but after reading I no longer felt bored. ",
1625,I was annoyed because I wanted the experiment to end as it was long.,
1626,I felt it easier to unconsciously and consciously find new words based on feelings as well as words that were in the material I read,
1627,"just a blank space on certain words, trying not to use the same word",
1628,I needed to be more aware of my surroundings and the details of life. We walk past things each day and don't see them.,
1629,very good experience ,
1630,It felt like I kept thinking of the events and specific words in the story. I was somewhat come but also very curious and felt more active.,
1631,"I guess the main thing I would say is that my headspace was still caught up in the feeling from the story.  Sort of an ethereal, melancholy headspace.  I quite enjoyed the story and I think subconsciously that my mind didn't want to let go of the experience of the story.  That's the best way I can put it, and hopefully that is the kind of answer you were looking for.  ",
