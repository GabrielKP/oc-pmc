1567,"I really had no strategy when playing the word chain game, but I began with the most prominent thought I had because I have to mow the grass today. The birds are chirping outside and the dog barked. I just tried to come up with random words that would not form a sentence, which was challenging. The second game was more difficult because of the words from the story that stuck in my mind. By then, a lawn mower had begun outside, which made plenty of noise that I could not ""turn off"" or affect in any way. I also tried very hard to think of words that might not have occurred in the story, and I began thinking of music for the second game. Since I'm sort of a word nut, the idea that the words were not supposed to make sentences affected my thinking. As soon as I wanted to connect the word to the next, I tried to shift to another subject. I did not use the strategies listed in the following two questions because I tried to focus on a subject such as music, which created a mental image in my mind of people performing on a stage. When that subject became empty, I was still thinking of the story, so wanted to choose words that were not involved, if possible because I did not want to let it influence my thinking.
