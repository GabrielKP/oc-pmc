1506,"I was less enthusiastic about playing the word chain game after reading the story, not because of the story but because it was the second time doing the game. I wasn't sure that you could use words from the first word chain game in the second word chain game. Also, it seemed to be a long time doing the game, and I started running out of potential words to write.","harder,other"

1532,"Seeing that it was after already reading the start of a story that had a darker theme to it, going into a word chain game in the middle of it when things were being hinted at slowly threw me off a loop for a moment. Because of that, the time it took to think of words was slightly more longer than the first round since my head was split between the story and finishing the game with enough words in time.","lingering,harder"

1567,"I had less trouble with the first word-chain game the first time because I had nothing in my mind except the overarching task of mowing that was looming for later today. I could randomly come up with words, such as animals and relate a few of them together. After reading the story, I only tried not to be influenced by the repetitive words from what I had read. The story felt vivid enough to me that the words used in the descriptions were too fresh to concentrate fully on the word chain as well, but I tried to use that as a challenge. I attempted to think of words that were not related to the story, but I'm not certain that I succeeded in doing so.
