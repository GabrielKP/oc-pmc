1004,I felt a wee bit more somber. ,
1056,I didn't feel any significant changes. I was just more determine to concentrate on playing the word games.,
1063,"Felt fine. I just wanted to stick within the parameters of my directions, so I push the button twice every time I thought about different things.",
1082,"I noticed I was more happier while thinking where the story would go. I was also thinking why would they just leave the body there. I was constantly fighting thinking of words and thinking of the story, so I was thinking about it more.",
1126,I felt more involved in the game after the story.,
1233,I didn't feel a change. I focused on the items around me in order to complete the task.,
1234,I was only bored with coming up with new words,
1235,after reading the story i noticed we should be vigilant at all times,
1236,"I thought of more gruesome words, like murder. It set my mind in a darker place. I wouldn't say it was too noticeable of a change though, because I'm naturally a pessimist. ",
1237,After reading the story I felt a sense of grief and sadness and perhaps this reflected in some of my word choices.,
1247,I did not feel very many changes during the chain game. I kept my same strategy during both rounds. The story was on my mind a bit so I think some words can be reflective of that.,
1248,I felt frustrated,
1249,I simply felt like I had more recent experience to go off of after reading the story.  ,
1250,I think it was harder to come up with words because I was trying not to use the same words as the first time. I also thought of words from the story sometimes. ,
1251,"I felt uneasy after reading the story and it was hard to concentrate. I specifically kept thinking about how her husband and his friends found the body, and how Claire must have felt about her husband. It was hard for me to think of new words without associating them with the story because I wanted to know how it ended.",
1252,"I followed the story but it was not until the after questions that I realized that she was accusing him of the murder. I followed the story, but as I use mostly images in interpreting it, I couldn't understand what was happening.  I tend to read things that way, very visually, and sometimes don't follow the story. So I was in that ""visualize"" mode and it was more challenging for me to think of words.",
1253,"The first chain word game was all exciting, the reading part to me because confusing almost as bored when it comes to pressing enter whenever you finish a sentence. The second word chain game wasn't as exciting, I could not think of food.",
1254,I did not experience any specific changes.,
1255,I was thinking about the story after reading it. And some words from it came to my mind.,
1256,One of the changes I felt was aggravated. As much as I wanted to do well on the second chain game my mind wouldn't let me. I kept thinking about the story. I desperately wanted to know if Stuart was the killer.,
1257,I was more likely to think of outdoor scenes. I was more likely to recall words that had to do with nature.,
1258,I was more distracted,
1259,I just felt more bored and frustrated trying to come up with new words.,
1260,I felt that it was harder to come up with words with the story in the back of my mind.,
1261,"I FELT PREOCCUPIED AFTER READING THE STORY, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH WORDS.",
1262,"I felt a complete change in tone in myself. A carefree study suddenly became something where the story weighed heavily on my heart. Even though I assumed it was fiction, I couldn't stop thinking about it.",
1263,The word generator task was less boring because there was something running in the background. ,
1264,I felt very interested in the word game throughout. ,
1265,"I didn't feel any changes of emotions while playing the word chain game the second time, it's just since I don't know the ending of the story, I felt so curious, like something was hanging, not completed. I tried to start the word chain the second time with topics that were unrelated to the story but found myself unintentionally making a relation between the words that I typed to the story. ",
1266,I just felt like I had another thing on my mind the story. so I guess it was a little easier to come up with words because I had more on my mind.,
1267,"I would say that in the first minute or so of the word chain game I was very relieved to have something different to focus on after that story, which as I have said before, I felt revulsion after having read the story and, as I've said before, I thought it was quite disturbing. Sometimes elements of the story would intrude as I was picking words. When I was thinking of words that evoke landscapes, for instance, my mind returned to the discovery of the girl's body, for instance. I think that putting some effort into coming up with words in this game helped me to put the story out of my mind somewhat so that there was a noticeable difference at the end for me.",
1268,"My mind did begin to think about the topics of the story more than I expected them to. However, I do not feel that it had a large impact on how I played the game. Some words I used in the game were words that I typically would have not thought of if it wasn't for the story.",
1269,"It felt easier to come up with words in the second round, but it was much more difficult to follow the rule and not think of the story. The game was a more engaging experience as well. There was no boredom and the time seemed to pass a lot quicker.",
1270,"The story made me feel sad generally. It affected my mental consciousness. In all, i enjoyed playing the game. ",
1271,"This was a new exercise and I found myself having trouble creating the word chain out of random thoughts. The rules that were put forth created a mental roadblock. In addition, I found myself hitting this block, then having to start up my mental momentum again and restart the chain of thoughts and words. It became tiring. ",
1272,I didn't feel any specific changes after reading the story.,
1273,The only difference was that food didn't seem to come to mind at all.  ,
1274,I felt bored for the mostly.This being primarily as the story touched dull moments.,
1275,,
1276,"I was more focused on the word chain game after reading the story. It was harder to continue the word chains, but I felt that during the second word chain game, the chain was must more related throughout the game, especially from beginning to end. It was easier to keep the chain more related even though I was slower at generating words because my mind was on the story.",
1277,I felt more pressure the second time I played the game than the first time.,
1278,I was entering more words that pertained to the story than the first round.,
1319,There was a sad and eerie feeling after the story. I wanted to know how the story ended and I kept thinking about it. I can relate to feeling more emotional after the story for sure.,
1320,"I felt bored especially during the second time I played the game. I still tried to keep my imagination active and used the meaning of the words I used to remind me of other words. It was a brief boredom though, I was still able to enjoy the task for the most part.",
1321,"After reading the story, I was curious to know how it would end. When it was time to start playing the word chain game I had a slightly difficult time transitioning because I was still thinking about the story. I became more interested in reading the story than playing the game. ",
1322,The mood was different.,
1323,"I felt a need to try and come up with things unrelated to the story, and in that way, it was somewhat more difficult and felt different than the first round. I felt more emotion, because I had just finished the (very good) story, and so I felt closer to my emotions in the second round. I felt more awake after the store, not less. I was not bored at all during the first round, but even less during the second as I had to focus due to the increased difficulty. ",
1324,I was kind of upset about the murder in the story of a young girl.  I was also impressed how well the story was written.  ,
1325,"The story was somewhat tragic, so I felt sad when playing the second word chain game. I also wanted to know how the story ended.",
1326,I just thought about how robotic the story seemed.,
1327,I think the priming of not thinking about the story actually bled through the words that I used in the word chain. It seems like the don't think instruction is actually shaping the nature of the exercise.,
1328,some bad feelings shifting from one stage to another,
1329,,
1330,I think my mind started thinking more about darker things like crime. I thought it was perhaps slightly harder to come up with words. ,
1331,"My words were more focused on death, murder, and story plots",
1332,I was just thinking of words that related to the story.,
1333,"My thoughts came a lot faster. I figured I'd probably be asked questions about the story, so I was also trying to remember what details I could while playing the word game. I guess I was more distracted from the actual game itself the second time, even though I was typing whatever words came to mind. It was kind of autopilot v. actively thinking about the words. I'm a terrible speller, and I also worried less about that as I typed. At first I was like, ""What will these researchers think of me when they see I can't spell potato?"" The second time around I thought, ""That's close enough that they'll know what I mean, and it's not like they can find my fifth grade teacher and report on how horribly she failed."" I also thought a lot about the story itself and whether or not it was written by AI or an actual author. At first I thought AI but changed my mind as the story progressed. I thought about trying to find the story to read it as a whole. I hated pressing enter to get to the next sentence. I like seeing the sentences as part of a paragraph. I felt like I could get more into the story that way. So, I was thinking about all that during the second game. During the first I was mostly focused on the game itself and oddly struggled more to come up with words. ",
1334,I felt no specific changes after reading the story.,
1335,I just felt a little curiosity.,
1336,"I don't think I felt a huge change other than the themes that came up, but I was already thinking in the first set of the exhaustion of life and love and the story just happened to reiterate some of those themes.",
1337,I felt the word chain game was boring the second time around. Maybe it's because the murder story was an exciting stimuli and to go back to the word chain game just made me bored. I felt like my mind wanted to do more tasks associated with that murder story instead of the word change game. ,
1338,"not really changes, but by the time the last game came up, I felt like I was running out of words to us, so maybe a little bored?",
1339,I felt myself being angry at the men in the story like I had known them personally. ,
1340,Didn't really notice that many changes,
1341,"The changes I felt was a feeling of wondering, I couldn't help but to keep wondering what happened next. I also felt that it was easier to come up with words this go round, due to the story being stuck in my head. So I used some of the words that related back to the story. ",
1342,The story was interesting but it felt never ending.,
1343,Just felt drained and could only think about the story,
1344,I did not feel much changes except getting bored when I could not immediately think of new words.,
1345,I think the only change I really noticed was how the themes and content of the story influenced the kinds of word associations I came up with.,
1346,"I felt tireder, more wrung out physically and emotionally, and the topics that came to mind were darker and more serious. I did not feel as happy about the task.",
1347,I felt a shift in thoughts as I moved from one category of things to another.,
1348,I felt that the story I read changed the kind of words I used for the second game at times. ,
1349,"I think I was not more emotional, but more in tune wtih my own emotions",
1350,I was disturbed by the story and the words that popped into my head were probably related to it because it was fresh in my mind.,
1351,"I think I was worried I was just going to come up with words from the story and not use what my mind was actually thinking of, if that makes sense. I did find my self at the start of the second round thinking more in ""ideas"" or pictures and not specific words. ",
1352,"I enjoyed reading the story. My first go around it was tough to think of new words to say. But after I had more words I could think of and it was more enjoyable to type them then before. Even though towards the end of the word game I still struggled, It was still much easier.",
1353,,
1354,My thoughts were definitely darker after reading the story. It was hard to come up with words that didn't relate to the story.,
1355,I felt different emotions from sadness to confusion after reading the story that carried to the game.,
1356,great one,
1357,Noticed that I was thinking of more words I had heard or read about in the story.,
1358,I felt like I was more focused the second time.,
1359,i didn't feel any thing,
1360,the story was longer than i anticipated so i increasingly got bored but also wanted to make sure i was paying attention in case I had to recall information from the story. ,
1361,I had words in my mind but the story kept coming up so i would use those words instead ,
1362,I really dont believe it changed how i played the game at all. Like honestly.,
1363,My thoughts didnt change much throughout I just focused on the current task.,
1364,I felt more occupied during the second-word chain game.  More thoughts were in my mind while playing the second round.,
1365,More words reminded me of the story.,
1366,I was really impresses with the outcome of events,
1367,"Most of the changes I had were influenced by what was on my mind at the time, be it food to eat, the story, what's happening in the house, what I did today prior to this study, what I plan on doing later tonight, and so on. ",
1368,,
1369,I mostly didnt want to think of the story,
1370,"I felt emotionally invested, intrigued by the story. I felt like I needed to know how it ended, who murdered the girl. I felt like anything I thought about after the fact could trace back to the story. ",
1371,Biggest change would be that I naturally shifted away from worse I used previously almost unconsciously and the story obviously changed how I thought of certain topics related to it so I had to shift my mindset again to kind of get away from focusing on just the story.,
1372,I felt like I wanted to know how it ended or if the story was going to end for closure.,
1373,"Words I came up with all felt like they were related or could be close to words that were relevant to the story. Also, I felt like I tried to use words that were similar a lot more on the second experiment.",
1374,I had a good experience ,
1375,No changes just liked it,
1376,"I specifically thought of words than described the story I read.  It really overwhelmed my thinking process, as the story was so vivid. ",
1377,"I think I was a bit more tired after reading the story, but I did notice that a few of the words reminded me of some parts of the story.",
1378,I thought about things associated with Halloween towards the end.,
1495,"The story was very interesting. I was thinking about the story and it was easier to come up with some words. Yet, at the same time, I oddly felt distracted by the story during the game. I definitely didn't feel tired or bored, just very interested and curious about the ending.",
1496,It was quite difficult to come up with words in the second round without thinking of the young lady in the story,
1497,I was more tired as the second time. The time also felt much longer. ,
1498,"After reading the story, I felt a change in emotion because of the seriousness of the story. There were moments were I thought of words that related to the story. The plot of the story just lingered overall in my mind.",
1499,I felt nervous and anxious while playing the game. I felt impacted by the story when thinking up words,
1500,Not applicable,
1501,"In the beginning I was grasping for ideas and thoughts, words. After the story it lead me to ponder the overarching ideas touched on in the story such as death, mystery, suspicion and safety.",
1502,the story was in my mind so coming up with words was a little more difficult,
1503,i didnbt feel a change,
1504,"If I remember correctly, it seems I was a bit slower in my responses (typing the words) after reading the story. I had more trouble thinking of words as not many words would pop up in my mind. My mood was also slightly different (more unpleasant/sad) after reading the story. ",
1505,was just trying to comprtehend,
1506,I felt more anticipation for what happened next in the story. I was emotinoally invested in the characters. ,
1507,"I felt like I was surprised I read a story. I don't read at all, so I was wondering what made so interesting. That's a good author I guess.",
1508,Some of the aspects of the story were present but not in an overwhelming fashion. ,
1509,i had some changes after reading the story because it was so touching,
1510,My thoughts seemed more directed. I felt like I had a fixed reference point I could use. I tried to avoid referring back to the story but it was difficult.,
1511,"I was more focused on specific aspects and tones of the story than anything else. I felt like there were more specific parameters guiding my thoughts instead of being more like a free for all, or more specifically being dominated by food thoughts.",
1512,"I was feeling a bit emotional after reading the story, which affected my mood and the words that I chose for the second round, especially in the beginning. I also found that if I was running out of words to enter, I would think back on the story of words that were in it or that I could associate with it.",
1513,Words in the story came to mind when originally I was thinking of items or ideas related to the area around me. Some of the emotional impact of the story reformed the word in my mind as I was thinking. ,
1514,I liked this experiment. I was just truly invested in the story that when I had to switch to the game it was difficult,
1515,I felt apprehensive as I was trying to focus on the words for the game.  I had difficulty changing my train of thought to the word game,
1516,I was specifically trying to steer my thoughts but it wasn't working.,
1517,"The story had a darker tone so it changed my way of thinking for the second game. Where the first game was more random, the second game was more focused on what I had just read.",
1518,The only thing that changed was the topics I was thinking of which I kind of discussed previously. It just made me think of more story-related words. ,
1519,"Both times, the word game was fun! I did feel a change in emotion slightly, as the subject of the story was quite heavy and it made me sad. ",
1520,After the story I felt a little more drained. I could not focus as easily. Probably because of the disturbing nature of the story.,
1521,"I really like to read, but it's hard to comprehend when it's a sentence at a time.  I'm a little confused by the reading, all involved, events, as there was some jumping around.  I hope to find the book and read it for more clarity.",
1522,"It was much harder to come up with words after reading the story. I felt like I was grabbing at any word I could! They felt sporadic and strange to me. The words that come to my mind felt really unnatural, as if my mind was reaching for anything to come up with, except for words from the story. I didn't feel bored or tired, actually the opposite. I felt surprisingly awake and energetic.",
1523,"It was a lot harder to come up with ideas the 2nd time around because of the immersion of the story. Also, I felt like the more I pushed the thoughts away the more I had to double tap spacebar. The big themes of the story for the 2nd I felt popped up the most in my head like the murder, the fishing trip, and the guy following her. ",
1524,"The words had more negative themes I think, similar to the story.",
1525,"I didn't feel any majors changes. Some parts of the story came into my head, but I found the story hard to follow in the way it was presented.",
1526,I noticed minimal differences playing the word game before and after the story,
1527,it was harder to come up with the words after the story because i was thinking about the story more,
1528,no changes,
1529,"I felt myself getting distracted by the story, trying to think of whether words I was using was related to the story. It was a lot easier to avoid food-related words than the story-related words.",
1530,I liked this sort of game and wanted to be good at it (not lose track of the word I had submitted once it disappeared). I didn't notice any changes in the second round of play except that I knew the rhythm of the game from round one and I was distracted a few times with thoughts of the story as words I used reminded me of it.,
1531,i felt emotional after reading the story what clair and his husbands have to pass through and also the death of the young girl,
1532,"After reading the short story, I felt more emotional and felt sympathy for the person in the story. I was thinking of the water and visualizing that scene. My mind came up with so many more words and related words after that. It became much easier for me.",
1533,non,
1534,It was just a feeling of being in the story.,
1535,Well I went from being happy to feeling sad after reading the story it made me think about the messed up world we live in which I was not feeling before.,
1536,No specific changes were felt...,
1537,"The word chain game is much less interesting than the story, and I had already done it once, so I found myself more bored and restless the second time",
1538,I felt more negative and had more negative thoughts.  ,
1539,the story in itself made my experience change. as for the second phase of the word chain i quite assume the story had a great influence on my choice of words,
1540,"I just felt it was easier throughout the second half of the word chain game to distract my thoughts on just the words and feelings from the story, as it was very difficult in the beginning of the word chain game to think of one thing that wasn't from the story I just read.",
1541,I felt more preoccupied mentally with the story when trying to come up with the word chain in the second round.,
1542,I definitely felt bored and like I wanted the study to end.,
1543,I felt like I had to focus more in the 2nd round trying to not think about the story. After finishing the story I immediately knew I would follow up on it and check it out after this survey ended so that made it easier for me to dismiss it. I'm pretty sure the story takes place in my state so I am more inclined to read again.,
1544,"Didn't really change how I felt. I just suppressed thinking about the story by continuing to type words of things in my environment or how I feel generally, regardless of the story.",
1545,As I kept on typing I was loosing interest a bit,
1546,"I felt more sad and definitely related words to do with family, love, trust etc. ",
1547,"I was in disbelief that the men would simply ignore the dead body in their midst, and fish next to it, play next to it, relax next to it, and sleep next to it.  They did all this as though it were a dead branch.  This is not at all typical of the men who are in my family and social circle.  This is nothing like the men in my community where I grew up.  The men in the story are utterly insane.",
1548,It is difficult to know since I think I was aware that the study was trying to see if the story influenced my word choices,
1549,There was no change in my thought,
1550,I felt intrigued by the story as it kept popping up in my head while coming up with words. I had  thoughts in my mind about how the story would end,
1551,"I feel like the first word chain it took me a while and I was more focused on finding word after word, the second one the words were just popping up, but it was mostly negative and adjectives or descriptors versus the first game where it was a lot of nouns. ",
1552,"I felt more engaged after the story. Not that I was bored before, but the process of coming up with words felt easier after reading the story. This is because I had an interesting story visualized in my mind that I could pull from. It being well-written was also a factor, because it immersed me and I found it more engaging to come up with words.",
1553,I felt that I kept obsessing about the story. This did not feel good and I felt I could not concentrate and the words were not my own but rather from the story I read. ,
1554,No i felt no particular change,
1555,,
1556,i kind of liked the word game the second time around b/c i had a better feel for it ,
1557,Just feeling emotional about this,
1558,i felt no changes at all,
1559,,
1560,"I felt similar, but thought of murder mysteries more than food items",
1561,I noticed my emotions were a bit more negative in the second round. The story elements came to mind a lot. It was a bit harder for me to come up with words after the first story session.,
1562,I felt like certain words stuck in my head after reading the story.,
1563,"As I said, it was harder to focus but more mentally than emotionally. The story was vivid and preventing it from intruding was difficult.",
1564,"i really did not feel or have anything to share, sorry! it was a good story but i found it easy to not focus on it a lot during the typing part.",
1565,,
1566,"A specific change I felt was that the words that came to mind were inspired by the story. Moreso at the beginning of coming up with words, although throughout the words could be related to the story.",
1567,I think it was easier to think of words in the word chain in the second part after reading the story.,
1568,I thought the story was brutal and gruesome and didn't want to reflect on it for too long.,
1569,Very bad,
1570,"It was difficult to stop thinking about the story, even though I tried. And I felt kind of sad and scared.",
1571,While playing the game I was focused on answering the questions and I didn't think about other things.,
1572,I was thinking about the story sometimes while playing the word game.,
1573,"I was probably more imaginative when I was trying to think of words for the second game. Instead of thinking of an isolated object, I thought about the whole room or environment that object/word would be in.",
1574,"I felt more focused, I felt more engaged, and I also felt that I had more words to write. ",
1575,"After reading the story, I felt sadness and slightly concerned. It was shocking the group decided to let the body float instead of reporting it immediately. It makes me question how often something like this really happens.",
1576,"I guess the second time felt a bit heavier.  The first go-round was light and breezy, but the story had affected my mood a bit.",
1577,"I found myself typing words that were related to the murder mentioned in the story. I also typed words that came from the story events, such as hiking or the phone ringing. I also felt my emotions change as there really wasn't much of an emotional aspect from before I read the story. After reading, I was definitely typing words that had more of an emotional component, such as death.",
1578,"I didn't notice any immediate changes while playing the word game, but I did think about the story a bit. Some of the characters and their behaviors were very vivid, so that was in my head a bit while playing the game.",
1579,I was able to use more words and have more words to use for game.,
1580,I felt like I was able to come up with more specific and more related words after I had read the story,
1581,I had more thoughts about the story and the varied ways it could have ended. I noticed a lot of words from the story that I seem to use when playing the word game as they were fresh in my mind when popping up. ,
1582,I was very focused on negative more than neutral things,
1583,I felt more dark.,
1584,There were no changes generally except incidents and conversations from the story popping up in my head once in a while,
1585,it felt great,
1586,I felt no change other than random memories of the story.,
1587,"The story was interesting and well-organized. The reader could easily picture the story scenes and events. I could even visualize Stuart and Claire's facial expressions. I thought of Claire as being very submissive. I was frustrated with the men for not taking the time to let the authorities know about the body as soon as they saw it. She was human after all. Emotionally, I felt sad for all of the characters, even Dean and his young innocence. I'm glad the story is over. I have the feeling I would have after seeing a movie in the drama genre.",
1588,n./a,
1589,"When I found myself thinking back to the story, I tried to think of other things. I tried to find words not related to the story towards the end of the game. ",
1590,I did not feel any specific changes. I was focused on completing what I was told to do. There were no changes for me personally. Everything was the same.,
1591,To be honest I didn't really notice too much of a change on specific changes on how I felt. I didn't really feel bored or tired during the word chain game. Sometimes random topics did come to mind and sometimes it didn't. Coming up with words in general for the game was relatively easy. I didn't feel any specific changes one way or another. ,
1592,I mainly focused on new word ideas,
1593,"I think mostly the changes I felt just related to how the story made me feel. A little unsettled I guess would be the best way to describe it, and lacking closure. These feelings affected the early part of the second word game for me, as I still felt like I was kind of processing the story. I do not feel it made it easier or harder to come up with words, and passed the beginning of the second word game I don't think the story effected me much at all.",
1594,"It was mostly the exact same, except for feeling a bit more bored and tired.",
1595,"I didn't want to remember the story because it was disturbing for me, I tried to erase it from my mind after reading it, but the words were coming into my mind unintentionally",
1596,"I thought it was easier to come up with words as my mind had been quite stimulated by the story. It allowed me to branch out a little further in the word activity, and participate in those thoughts when they arose. This was almost like a study of what stuck the most with me.",
1597,the first round was boring and I typed random words. In the second round I felt more engaged because I was thinking of the story. In the second round I thought of the story most of the time.,
1598,There wasn't really any noticeable changes.,

1600,"I definitely felt a change in emotion and also the difficulty it took for me to come up with words especially after reading the story. I kept thinking of the events and one of the things that stood out to me was that I typed in napkins in the first chain game and realized early on, napkins was another word in the story too so I kept finding connections with words.

1602,I felt like it was harder to think of words that did not relate to the story. ,
1603,I was very tense after the story so playing the game afterwards was cathartic for me. I was able to concentrate on it much easier after the story.,

1612,"Basically like I stated before the story kept coming up as I tried to think of words. I think previously I mainly stuck to foods and animals. After the story I thought of things related to camping, or lakes. I also thought of words that related to different scenes, like car.",
1613,"The change was more like motivation. I had lots more ammo for the word chain game, more energy.",
1614,I really didn't have any. I was trying not to repeat any words I used in the first game. ,
