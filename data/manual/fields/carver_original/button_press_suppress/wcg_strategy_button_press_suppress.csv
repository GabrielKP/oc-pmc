1023,I just tried to keep thinking of words.  If I got stuck I looked for an item around me and tried to just keep thinking of related words.,
1041,I just thought of the first word that came to mind.  I looked at my surroundings to find words. ,
1081,"I just said whatever came to mind. Then when nothing came to mind, I looked around my room and used things I saw. ",
1085,"I tried to think of settings, subcultures, and above all else, categories of words, that are completely unrelated to the thing that I'm supposed to not think about.  I first started typing many words, ignoring how the box ignored my single spacebar input to separate the words, so perhaps a character limit on that field could be useful, just in case any future participant makes the same mistake.  I have a friend who practices the art of freestyle rap, and I have spent many hours doing this activity myself, so the ""No Food Words"" requirement was not new to me.  Thus, it's difficult to say exactly how my background may affect my word choices in this study.  ",
1229,I visually pictured the words I typed and the next word I selected was usually something that could be seen near the original word.,

1381,I took the words that came to my mind and used synonyms of those words.,
1382,"During the first round of the word chain game, I just typed the first words that came into my head because I wasn't thinking much about food.
