1005,Thank you ,
1023,I just felt it was harder to come up with words after reading the story because I was trying not to think of anything in the story but there were so many words that would make me think of the story.,
1041,During the second word game it was hard to not think of the story and words associated with the story.  It was much easier to not think about food.,
1081,"I think the food was an intentionally boring topic so it was easier to put it out of my mind. There are endless things in my room that I can type so when I ran out of things that came to mind naturally, I looked around for things in my eyesight and used those. So it was essentially an endless stream of non-food words. The story was a little different because it was more interesting and more difficult to suppress thoughts of. But it still was not something that came to my thoughts often.",
1085,"I didn't notice any specific changes.  I have played other ""timed language puzzle challenge"" games in the past and my brain feels similar to how it feels after playing one of those.  Perhaps more energized and focused in the moment, but more tired in terms of how much energy I have until my next break.  ",
1229,"There was a feeling of melancholy that came over me after reading the story. While I was once excited playing the word chain game, after reading the story, I was more calm. ",
1230,By the end of the word chains it was beginning to feel tedious.,
1231,i felt like i could supress thoughts better the second time- because I was able to follow directions and do it previously.,
1232,I felt that it was easier to come up with words that were not food than the story because I felt that several words I chose could have somehow been related to the story.,
1238,I felt easy and calm,
1239,Words are powerful and can make you imagine the reality of what is being said or described,
1240,,
1241,I felt changes in the words that I thought of. It was harder to come up with them and each time I did it seemed like it could tie back to the story.,
1242,my experience was great and there was no really specifice change.,
1243,"Seems like i kept coming back to words that were related to the story, like car or kid.",
1244,"Honestly at the beginning of each round it was much easy but as you progress, you start running out of words and that's when different emotions starts setting in.",
1245,"Honestly, I didn't notice much change because I just thought of completely random words for both games",
1246,I was touched by the story and fully immersed in it.,
1279,I felt fixated on the details of the murder. But I was able to put it aside during the second exercise. ,
1280,The changes I felt were to come up with a word that would be a starting point that was obviously different from food or for the story I had read.,
1281,I didn't really feel any changes other than my mind wandering to the story that one time. ,
1282,I didn't really feel any changes. What do you want me to say? ,
1283,"After reading the story, I felt anxious and curious because of how the story ended. It became harder for me to think about the positive moments that I had experienced in my life while playing the game because of the story that I just read.",
1284,My emotions were more sad after the story and playing the word chain game in the second game.,
1285,"The changes I felt were thinking about items that related to the story.  I apparently could not get those out of my head.  BUT I also felt like I shouldn't just repeat all of the words I used in the first game.  So I was pretty much scraping the bottom of the barrel for random words, if that makes sense.",
1286,I did not feel any specific changes. I read the story and really liked it when I was typing I would sometimes think of the story because I had just read it.,
1287,"Throughout the game, I was really calm.  I enjoyed the story but I was equally quick to cast it aside when I needed to focus on something else.  I was really absorbed in the story because I find it quite interesting.  I wasn't disturbed by the murder in the story because I knew it was fiction.  So didn't have much emotion other than being intrigued.",
1288,Not any specific changes. Just reflections of the story I read,
1289,I felt a little bit bewildered at the actions of the people in the story.  A little angry at some of the men's decisions and the guy who followed Claire.  My mood got gloomy.,
1290,"nothing note worthy just that with the story something like breakfast could be seen as related or even grass,lake,mountain etc.",
1291,"My mood was slightly more pensive I guess, due to the story",
1292,It felt more tense on the second round because it was more difficult to avoid thinking about the story.  I wouldn't say I felt different playing it other than that.,
1293,I used the same strategy for both word chain games. The second time it was a little harder to come up with words that doesn't make me think of the story.,
1294,I HAVE A CLEAR IMAGE OF THIS HAPPENING WHY ISN'T THIS OVER,
1295,,
1296,I felt engaged in the story. it made me want to know more. i had a lot more curiosity and I also felt sad by what could have happened to the girl and how claire was being treated,
1297,"None really, I just focused differently, using an affirmative rather than a negative.",
1298,No changes in how i felt,
1299,I don't feel any significant changes after reading the story. Only some small and random details came to my mind while playing the world chain game after reading the story. ,
1300,there werent any changes ,
1301,I did not feel any significant difference between the two rounds of the word game.,
1302,I felt like the game became more serious and less fun. It also made me feel like it was more emotionally charged.,
1303,I felt as if I was under pressure to avoid certain topics. I kept second guessing myself with topics and words to come up with.,
1304,It was more free flowing the first time around coming up with words and ddn't think twice about the words. But second time around certain words made me think of the story and make me want to keep reading;.,
1305,My thoughts during the second word chain felt more melancholy than before I read the story. It was hard for me to keep my mind off of the story as I was wondering what had happened. ,
1306,"I didn't really feel any changes.  In both situations, the study mentions a topic and then immediately tells me not to think about that topic, so both word chain games felt very similar.",
1307,Very wonderful,
1308,,
1309,I think the words that came to my mind in the second word chain game were more negative,
1310,I had more of a heaviness that same over me and a little bit of fear. I went from thinking about shopping and the work I had for the rest of the day to feeling sad.,
1311,,
1312,none,
1313,"I feel a bit hungry now after it because the food related one got me thinking about food.  I also feel a little emotional after reading the story because it made me angry to read it.  I didn't feel any boredom during the task, it was quite engaging and I didn't really have time to let my mind wander so I liked how engaging it was. ",
1314,uhhh I thought of different words but a lot of them had to do with the story. Then I had to press double space. ,
1315,i enjoy myself through out the study,
1316,I felt sad after reading the story,
1317,I just wanted to know what happened next in the story,
1318,"I felt that words were easier to come up with, yet, many of the words reminded me of the story or were about the story itself.  This made it both easier to complete the task, but I was also trying to suppress these ideas at the same time.",
1379,I felt that thoughts of food were harder to keep my mind from thinking as opposed to the story,
1380,"After the story, I was thinking deeper into my responses.  Before the story I just kind of ""went with whatever"".",
1381,"I just felt like it was easier to think about things like death, sex, or anger after reading the story as opposed to before I read the story. Before I read the story my words were a bit more positive or at the very least neutral.",
1382,"For some reason when I was playing the first round, I was thinking of a lot of court words (trial was one that kept coming to mind), and since those kinds of words would obviously relate to the story, I had to change the topic my words were about ",
1383,"I noticed that it was tough to not think of the story or any words related to the story when doing the word chain activity after reading it. I found it especially difficult near the beginning of the activity. However, I did not experience any kind of specific changes other than that.",
1384,,
1385,"The atmosphere in my mind changed to something more dire and serious, reflecting what the story had impressed upon me.",
1386,"It was harder to come up with words as I was trying not to come up with any that could be related to the story. I was slightly agitated. I think I wanted to ruminate on the story, but I had to complete the word chain at that time.",
1387,Thought of scenery more,
1388,"I think my mind got into a more story-telling mode, it was at first harder to come up with words since I was thinking about the story but later I was able to come up with more words compared to the food section. ",
1389,Even when I wasn't thinking of the story I caught myself using words that could be related.,
1390,My mind is somewhat consume with this horrible story. I just wanted it to end. I would have needed way more time to read and memorized this story. ,
1391,"I felt upset, moreso angry and annoyed that men behave like that all the time and as women, we're meant to go along with it, or suffer a similar fate. I'd rather just suffer the fate now, thanks. ",
1392,"Once again, I found myself thinking about how the girl was murdered. I was fixating on my mental image of her body.",
1393,I felt no changes,
1394,"I felt that I was thinking of slightly creepier words, and had better focus from the act of reading",
1395,like I was more actively suppressing the story during the word game. but I wasn't using a particular strategy.,
1396,only change was how bored i was during the game. that was because coming up with random words is a bit repetitive and doing it for a prolonged time to me is boring. ,
1397,"I felt determined to finish this study more than anything else. No matter how tedious, I was motivated to get it done.",
1398,"While playing the word game, I did not experience any word changes. I was more focused on completing the game. ",
1399,The story was a downer and not my kind of subject at all.  Of course it put me in a bit of a bitter mood especially reading it almost line by line.  It made it harder to do the second word change because it was hard to get the whole story out of my mind.,
1400,NONE,
1401,none,
1402,"I felt like I had to fight my thoughts to focus on anything but the story. It was very prevalent in my thoughts, so I had to push it out of my mind. ",
1403,I sometimes got a little bored. I also felt like it was hard to think of words. I guess because I knew that there was a 3 minute time frame. It was hard for me to think of the words that I knew that did not have to do with food.,
1404,"The story did slow my thinking down for the second round of the word game. Reading that much besides creative thinking can be a lot to take in a short period. However, I was able to stay focused and had fun and enjoyed both the game and the story. What a mystery!!",
1405,I found myself trying harder to keep the words grouped together. By group I mean how close they can be considered to each other. It made it easier to not think of the story,
1406,it was easier to stay more focused on the task and the story was clear and easily memorable.,
1407,"I felt heavy sadness, some anger, total revulsion because I thought the husband was an abusive bully. It was hard to shake. I also felt weird about claire, she was meek, weak. I didn't like that at all.",
1408,"I did not experience much change throughout, except it was annoying only seeing one sentence at a time.",
1409,The game was harder to focus on just because I wanted to ponder the end of the story more. I don't think I got more bored playing the game since it was quick and engaging but I do think my performance could have been better because I could focus more before the story,
1410,"I was having some carefree fun typing words into the word chain while avoiding food-related thoughts. Then, I read the story. I felt distracted, sad, and heavy-hearted. The word chain avoiding story-related thoughts got much harder to randomly think of words.",
1411,"I felt that my brain wanted to quit.  I had a harder time thinking of words because I felt more under pressure.  I kept ""thinking"" about memory itself in the back of my mind.",
1412,The changes were mostly story related.  Before I read it I was just inputting random words that came to mind.  After reading the story my mind was a lot more focused on it so I feel like my words were a lot less random and more related to the content of what I read.,
1413,I just had my mind on the story I had just read and the dark theme of the story. This was making me think of words related to the story at times and I had to focus more to come up with words which took longer.,
1414,,
1415,It was a very interesting study.,
1416,"I did get more tired and hungry as the game went on. After the story, my eyes and brain were a little more tired from the effort as well. ",
1417,"Felt a bit more difficult coming up with words due to trying not to think about the story, but still typing the first word that came to mind as the story kept coming back to mind after reading it. I find it easier to try not to think about food. I was also very interested in the story.  ",
1418,There is a certain darkness in thr story that no doubt affected some of the words I picked and probably caused me to think of it more often than food.,
1419,just reflecting on the story,
1420,The first word chain game was annoying because I did not understand the rules as well,
1421,I felt a little bit anxious at the beginning of the word chain game but my confidence grew along,
1422,I didn't feel any specific changes. I just knew the options were more limiting as the story covered a lot of basic everyday things.,
1423,I felt more subdued and reflective. ,
1424,I didn't think about changes - and don't really know how to answer this question,
1425,,
1426,I was very engaged in the story and wanted to keep reading so I couldn't stop thinking about it.,
1427,"Now that I think of it, I realize I think I had darker thoughts the second time around. I said words such as danger and things of that sort. It is interesting to think about that since the story is a bit dark that now more dark things popped into my head.",
1428,I felt more like it was effortful and draining to keep coming up with unrelated words.,
1429,I felt a rush while doing the second part after reading the story. My mind kept racing. Part of me wanted to know what actually happened at the end and who committed the murder,
1430,I just thought of the story a bit more compared to the food related topics,
1431,Felt thinking on story a bit sad. And trying picture it more.,
1432,I just focused & had fun,
1433,I did not feel any changes; in the second round I did try to avoid words I had used in the first round (though not instructed to do so) which was the only change I felt,
1434,I just had the story still alive in the back of my mind. It kept popping up sometimes as I wondered what happened to the story and also about the mysterious events that took place.,
1435,"None, other than concentration.",
1436,"After reading the story, all the light hearted stuff left my mind. I became more focused on my goal. Overall it felt much more serious.",
1437,I was more tired and felt a little upset by the story. It was a little harder to focus on the game after readying the story.,
1438,"I thought that the experience was engaging. I focused on the task at hand and didn't really think about food in the first part and the second part had me focused like the first, but managed to have me think about the story 2 different times throughout.",
1439,"I felt my mind trying to go back to the story since it felt like it ended on a cliff hanger, which I hate.  This made it difficult to focus.",
1440,Some bad aspects of the story I read kept disturbing my mind,
1441,,
1442,I just felt like the story kept coming back while playing the word game; much more than food.,
1443,I felt more negative and I had dark thoughts after reading the story. I didn't think about the word murder before but that word popped up in my mind in the second word chain game. ,
1444,I rather enjoyed the game. It was pleasant to just relax and be random in word usage.,
1445,was a little more difficult not thinking about the story during the second word chain. felt very empathetic so the story.,
1446,"when I thought of a word and if it was somehow related to the story, it would make me think of the story then I would try to clear my mind of it as quickly as possible.",
1447,its good and very challenging,
1448,"It was definitely more boring, as I'd rather be reading the story than playing the word game. And I was more somber, since the story was sad and eery. I was definitely more eager to be finished with the word game",
1449,It felt a little more tiring to put in the effort to try and remove thoughts of the story from the word chain game.,
1450,I think the only change I felt was it was easy to focus on the game because I didn't have to suppress my thoughts about food.,
1451,"Some words came from the story, I couldn't don't think about it",
1452,"New words came to mind as well as some of the same words. I'm not sure why the new words came to mind like they did, but it didn't have anything to do with the story",
1453,I was able to feel more confident in the second round. ,
1454,felt bad ,
1455,I was more intrigued after the story.  The story also helped stir up my creative juices.,
1456,"Nothing much was changed in terms of my feelings. My mind doesn't need much effort put in to avoid the topics as required, that is I avoid the topics passively, not with active thought. My mind wanders without going towards the topic automatically",
1457,I felt that I was not as bored completing the word chain game after the story. I also felt more curious as well.,
1458,,
1459,words triggered emotions and imagery,
1460,,
1461,Since I was so invested in the story I felt more somber playing the second word chain game compared to the first time. The story is obviously a heavier topic. When I was doing the word game the second time I used a lot of food items since I couldn't on the first word game. Since I was able to use food and think of the time I went to grocery store this morning to think of more items it felt easier to come up with things. ,
1462,I had a change ion thought especially when doing the second task because i had to take my mind off everything i just read and focus on creating words in my head,
1463,"It just felt like I was a little more on edge and felt like the thoughts were a little more intrusive about the story than about food. I didn't like the feeling much, so it made me more hesitant to answer anything, as I had to try and think of things that wouldn't make me think of the story.",
1464,felt more emotyional,
1465,I kept feeling for the women in the story and the son.  I felt sadness and sorrow and worry,
1466,"I simply had more on my mind in general after the story.  In some ways it was more distracting, in others it was easier.  Overall I felt much less bored the second time around.",
1467,"I really wanted to start using words I used in the first word chain game (as far as I could recollect them), as words coming to mind outside of thoughts of the story were far and few between.",
1468,I remained so calm and confident during the first and the second word chain game ,
1469,,
1470,"There was a definite emotion change within me after reading the story because the story still lingered in my mind while playing the word chain game. I felt scared but eager to learn more about the story. I wanted to know what was going to happen to Claire until the end. I also felt fatigued after reading the story because I focused heavily to try to remember as much as possible, so my mind was churning too much to come up with words during the word chain game.",
1471,"I felt the second round was somewhat painful because despite trying to block thoughts about the story, certain words triggered unsettling images from the story.",
1472,nothing hard,
1473,it was an interesting exercise and story,
1474,I felt a little more engaged after reading the story,
1475,I felt tired after reading the story. It was harder for me to focus on the word game while also suppressing my thoughts of the story. ,
1476,it was harder to concentrate on words not related to the story and harder to think thoughts outside of the story as well. ,
1477,I just was thinking about the story and words related to that when I was doing the game the second time. i was not thinking about murder and stuff in general just in the story and objects that were in the story.,
1478,"I felt physical changes as well. My heartbeat and pulses quicken after reading the story. I had more moments of 'blankness' where I had to stop, take a deep breath, before I could think of new words.",
1479,I don't think I felt any changes w/r/t the story outside of wanting to know how it ended.,
1480,"it did feel less boring to play the word game the second time around. but I'm not sure if that's due to the story or due to the fact that I knew I would be nearing the end of the study soon, and it always feels less boring to me to be almost done than to be just starting a piece of work.",
1481,I felt the story would impose itself in my thoughts and distract me from what I was doing and I had to get back on track. I didn't really feel other specific changes that I can describe.,
1482,"I felt myself trying to actively avoid places that were featured in the story, but doing this made me become more focused and would unintentionally bring the story back into my mind. ",
1483,I noticed a change in emotions while playing the word chain game after reading the story because I was remembering the emotions I felt while reading it.  It was still fresh in my mind.,
1484,the story  stirred me so  I  just  felt like I  could relate  to it as  if  I was  in one of  their shoes,
1485,I didn't really feel any different except wanting to know what happened with the rest of the story.,
1486,I felt kinda pulled in two different directions. I wanted to come up with words but the other half of my brain was thinking. What happens next am I on the right course.,
1487,easier or harder to focus ,
1488,much more focused during the second word chain,
1489,I zoned out into to thinking of words that I had read or seen on page. I thought of images of the words. I sometimes thought of memories. I didn't feel much change because I was focused on words.,
1490,"I mostly felt more tired after reading the story. Some of the imagery was a little graphic so those thoughts were more difficult to suppress. Additionally, the story had a sad implication which made me feel a little down.",
1491,I tried to clear my mind and come up with words by looking at what was in the house and sometimes connecting them together.,
1492,I was thinking about dead stuff/murder/murderers more after reading the story. That's really the only change I felt. ,
1493,It was easier to come up with the words before the story.,
1494,I was slower in responding.,
1619,there was none,
1620,"i didn't really notice any changes, other than it was hard to intentionally suppress the story. ",
1621,I didn't really,
1622,I was really immersed in the story. The sense of unease and foreboding the narrator felt rubbed off on me. It carried over into the second word chain game for me. I was feeling more negative emotions and a little on edge as I completed the second game.,
1623,"So when i did the second round, I found myself to be stumped quite a bit and kept pausing because i could not come up with words that were somehow not directly or indirectly related to the story. I found the second task much more difficult. In the first task, if i thought of food i would immediately think of another word and keep moving. In round 2, when i thought of a word that was story related, the next word that came to my mind was also story related and so on.",
1624,"During the second word chain, my mind was occupied with the story, which was very depressing and gloomy!",
1625,I felt it was easier to come up with words after the story than in the first word game.  I guess reading actual words jogged my vocabulary a bit.,
1626,Felt more bored as it went on. ,
1627,I felt more anxious than before I read the story. The story was very difficult to listen to.,
1628,Something happened in my personal life between the first and second word game so that changed my experience more than the story,
1629,It was definitely more difficult to come up with words the second time around. I hesitated much more often than the first time around.,
1630,I experienced no specific changes,
1631,I was determined to think of nice things.,
1632,"At first, I felt like I could draw upon a greater variety of words. I'm not sure about the extent but I definitely felt like I came up with words much more quickly. I also started paying attention to the connotation of words.",
1633,"Change in thought patterns, some emotional and others unintentional changes",
1634,It was a sad story so it brought me down a little but thinking of something silly especially compared to the first round brought me back up,
1635,"The immediate words that came to mind in the second round were ""death, murder, river"" and other words like those. It was really difficult to come up with words that were more wholesome.",
1636,I felt more ill at ease after reading that story.  Not sure what else to say about it. ,
1637,They were subtle natural changes. My mind drifted to the story then off again. I would then think of a topic for the words I was writing.,
1638,"i felt that my word choices should be much more serious, in a way. i also tried to use food words as a way to forget about the story temporarily.",
1639,none,
1640,,
1641,"It got harder to stop thinking about the story. If I really tried to stay in the moment though, I found I was able to do i.",
1642,i felt frustrated because i didnt know how many pages i would have to go through,
1643,,
1644,"The word game was the easiest, as words came to mind quickly. The story part was long, and I quickly forgot some parts. I did read it but may not have recalled it correctly.",
1645,I felt I can remember all the story after the chain game,
1646,I felt that my emotions were different and there were changes of topics that came to my mind.,
1647,"I wanted to go look up that story before finishing this study, to find out more about it, others opinions about it, but I made myself finish the study instead.",
1648,I felt more emotionally aroused after reading the story and was aware it was more difficult to suppress the thoughts; also started thinking of more negative or charged words. ,
1649,I felt a bit confused and had difficulty suppressing the story. The story was really vivid in my memory.,
1650,Not really anything else that I haven't already explained.,
1651,The story made it harder to focus on the word task,
1652,I felt like my I was suddenly pulled out of the story. It felt heavy and I felt a mixture of sadness and was curious about what would happen next. I had a lot of questions but I was interrupted by suddenly playing a game haha.,
1653,i can't put this into words ,
1654,Perhaps a little anxious. Fight or flight response. Not as in being scared or fear. Adrenaline. I really hated her husband and he seems like the type of man who probably beats his wife and kids.,
1655,"I think I was just having a hard time coming up with words because the game went on for a bit longer than anticipated, and then i started to panic and start thinking about the story/food.",
1656,The emotions that I was feeling after reading the story were much sadder and more serious. The words that I came up with were definitely reflective of that. It wasn't more difficult to come up with words but it was much more difficult to suppress thoughts of the story than thoughts of food.,
1657,It was harder to come up with themes that didn't eventually lead to something in the story.,
1658,any violent topics immediately brought me to the story so anything that could be dangerous like a knife would make me think of the story. i felt more tired but i think that is just from fatigue of typing ,
1659,I played faster to not focus on the story and it was easier that way since I had focus more.,
1660,I had a harder time coming up with words. ,
1661,I felt like my train of thoughts during the second word chain was darker.  I also didn't really think about food as much as I did in the first word chain.  I also felt distracted a little by the story in the second word chain and it felt hard to come up with words that weren't connected or didn't remind me of the story.  ,
1662,,
1663,"I was very sad and distraught about the story itself and that I could not include words from it to help myself process what I had just read. Thus, there was a change in my emotions, and it was also harder to come up with words when the story was on the front of my mind. I was not bored or tired.",
1664,"I felt a little bit sadder, and somehow got really tired quickly.",
1668,I felt more disturbed after reading the story and the disturbing feeling distracted me from the game more.,
1669,"My brain was working really hard to repress thoughts of the story, so it became more difficult to also concentrate on also producing new words that were different. It felt like my brain was having a really hard time multitasking ",
1670,,
1671,I enjoy this study a lot,
1672,I felt really stressed while playing the game after the story and I felt like I couldn't think of any new words that were going to be safe words that weren't going to lead me to think about the story. The gay was also difficult because I was trying not to repeat words but I felt like I had already used a lot of them up during the first round of the game. The biggest issue however though was that it felt like my mind when trying to think of words could not help but go to the story and think of words that were in the story. ,
1673,"The dark aspects of the story affected my mood a little bit, which in turn probably affected the types of words/concepts that were popping into my mind. I thought a bit more about death and darkness than the first time. I suppose mood is captured in emotions, so I don't think I really experienced much outside of the questions above (which is why I answered ""2"" to the last question).",
1674,I felt like I was less bored after reading the story because of its ability to keep your attention.,
1675,,
1676,just calm to a uneasiness,
1677,More difficult to concentrate on the task in the second round,
1678,I felt sad when thinking about my friends that I used to play with. ,
1679,"I felt a little more unease playing the word game the second time due to the content of  the story. I felt it was a little harder to suppress thoughts and I found myself thinking about the story more often than food. However, I felt like it was easier to think of words the second time playing the game because I was trying harder to suppress my thoughts.",
1680,I just felt less lighthearted and more serious.,
1681,The second time around was harder because there was a richer thought to get rid of. Food is not a story. it does not have the same level of complexity.,
1682,"It was getting harder to come up with words during the second word chain game. There was a little frustration there, but I found the whole process interesting.",
1683,I felt the words I was thinking about after the story were much more negative and not as random as the first time I tried the experiment ,
1684,"I did not seem to experience any specific changes in my feelings, though maybe the words that freely came to mind may tell a different story. ",
1685,"I felt a bit more tired, icky physically. But that could just be my own health issues. I thought less of food the second round. I was thinking a bit more about my slightly negative body sensations in the second round.",
1686,"Like I said previously, I found it hard to continue thinking about words that had nothing to do with what was already said in the story. Because of this, I had to look even further through my room and continue typing what I saw. I did double press a lot at the beginning because the story was still fresh in my mind - I was only thinking about it. I had to pause and just stop thinking so the story could go away for a bit before I could start thinking about words to type.",
1687,I thought about the story a lot at the beginning. some of the word choices were based on the story.,
1688,I didn't feel any changes other than feeling tired. ,
1689,It was a very interesting story and I couldn't stop thinking about the dead girl,
1690,I didn't feel any change,
1691,My strategy was to think of something and take words from that situation ,
1692,,
1693,,
1694,,
1695,"I didn't really notice a distinct change in how I felt, just curiosity and wanting to know how the story ends.",
1696,My experience was a positive one and there isn't any specific change that comes to mind,
1697,"Again, I didn't really feel any changes. I was more so focused on finishing the word game ",
1698,,
1699,I didn't really have any specific changes.  I just thought about what I couldn't think about in the first game and that helped me.,
1700,I felt myself more anxious during the second game after the story. ,
1701,It was more emotional and I felt a little anxious trying to come up with words that were not about the story. I also felt more disappointed with myself thinking of the story.,
1702,"Not many changes were felt, only that I was thinking about that story.",
1703,The only change was that I thought about the topic I was not supposed to think about more than in the first phase. ,
1704,,
1705,,
1706,I felt the same throughout ,
1707,I felt like more words I thought of were related to the story in the second game as it was still on my mind.,
1708,I felt more inclined to finish reading the story as I was playing the second word chain game. ,
1709,"Like I stated above, my focus and stress went through the roof on the second word chain game knowing that I needed to engage both short-term and working memory at once. I didn't want to fail at either task to maintain an overall high performance score.",
