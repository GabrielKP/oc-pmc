1145,I felt sadder and started to choose words that would cheer me up,
1146,"before i had no word bank in my mind, but after reading the story, i had a huge list",
1147,Words from the story were on my mind and I had to think to not use them.,
1148,The second time I felt more comfortable thinking of words.,
1149,more dark,
1150,I came up with words that were relevant to the story when I played the second time,
1151,I felt like the overall mood of the story stuck with me when I went into playing the word chain game for the first time. It almost set a certain tone to this task where things were a bit more eerie than they were when I played during the first word chain game. ,
1152,The first time felt more light hearted so I have a lot more light heard and semi - random terms in the first round. The second round the words are a bit more dark in tone since thats the feeling I got from the story and it just naturally carried over to the word game.,
1153,I had a subject to focus on. I used words from the story to help me play word game the second time. It was easier that way. The first time I just said whatever was relevant to my day maybe.,
1154,Before  reading the story I choose words from my day and after reading the story I chose words I saw from the story.,
1155,"After reading the story, my word choice was much darker. It was very much influenced with the theme of the story, a lot of it had to do with feeling unsafe and death. Whereas before the story, my word choice was pretty typical, standard stuff. ",
1156,not much of a difference,
1157,I felt the correct thing to do after the story was use words that I remembered from the story,
1158,before: i didnt understand After: i understood after reading and typed more shorter words to try to fit more words typed in 3 mins,
1159,no differences,
1160,i felt like this shouldnt be difficult as compared to the first ,
1161,"I was thinking of the story words more in the second round of the word chain game, while trying to avoid thinking of the unfavorable parts of the story",
1162,it opened my mind up more after reading,
1163,I felt more like my mind was drawn to words that pertained to the story after reading it.,
1164,The differences were that the story was in my mind after playing the game the second time compared in the first time it was more easy to make up words because the story was not in my mind. ,
1165,On the second one I was aware that the words I thought of should probably change under the circumstances (guessing what the experiment was about) but I didn't find that they did.,
1166,"I did feel a little different in the words I used my mind felt more inclined to use more viscous words. Especially the Predator, Prey symbolism I felt in the latter half of the story. Also how the woman almost felt like a accomplice to the ordeal which is why she went to the funeral as a way to relieve some of the guilt. ",
1167,it was the same experience for me throughout both times.,
1168,I felt words came easier ,
1169,It was bit more harder to think of words in my mind,
1170,I didn't feel as if there were any differences ,
1171,i wanted to fit in words about the story,
1172,none to speak of.,
1173,"I definitely had fun during the first round trying to make it a goal to write a word for each letter of the alphabet. I felt like I was on a run like trying to do as much as I could and felt my mind flowing through every thought.  On the second round, I felt slowed, heavy, and disturbed like I kept stopping myself from typing words that would remind me of the story. I felt like whenever I did write a word that I saw in the story, I would feel upset like being pulled back to the vivid story. ",
1174,Some words were more associated with the imagery,
1175,It was the same for me. I actually finished up with my alphabet using a word for every letter.  The story had no impact in my random chain of words because I was made aware that it was random.,
1176,not many differences i think,
1177,"It made me drained a little, like I was speeding through parts because my brain was already a little overworked.",
1178,The second time my responses were somewhat darker. I felt physically on edge still from the anticipation of reading the story,
1179,Before I read the story I wasn't focused on anything in particular. The words I came up with were pretty random. After I read the story my thoughts centered around it. So most of the words I thought of were related to the story.,
1180,"It seemed I had a few ""darker"" words come to mind more than the first time. I also seemed to find it easier to come up with a word faster. ",
1181,I wanted to use words that pertained to the story I had just read.,
1182,The story was in my mind ,
1183,"before reading the story. I was very open-minded about typing the words, and after reading the story, I was narrowly mined, words kept on coming into my mind.",
1184,I felt like the words I picked the second time around were darker and more serious.,
1185,,
1186,I felt the second round was trying to manipulate me into using words from the story,
1187,it was the same,
1188,I felt the story had some influence on the words i submitted after ,
1189,"The main difference was just that I had already listed most of the things in my immediate environment the first time, and didn't want to repeat myself, so I had to strain a little more to come up with different things.",
1190,before the story I was just letting words flow or grabbing them as they popped into my head. Doing the word chain immediately after reading the story made all of the word chain words associate with the story in my my head.,
1191,it was bit harder to focus on not using any of those words from the story.,
1192,no difference I kept to just words that entered my mind,
1193,no difference,
1194,"Compared to before reading the story, I was thinking of more words that related to the story. I thought of more words relating to outdoors and traveling, while in the first round, I thought of words relating to my current surroundings.",
1195,i feel like some of the words i mentioned in the first word chain game were maybe in the story?,
1196,After the story I had water on my mind,
1197,"I felt heavier, more emotionally driven after reading the story. I tried to not let it dominate my word choices after but I think it did anyway.",
1198,The second time my words were influenced by the story at first.,
1199,"after reading, my words were more violent and sexual in nature.",
1200,"After reading the story I was consciously attempting to choose words that were not in the story or a selection of the language/words used in the story. When a word came to mind I briefly considered how much that word choice was influenced by the story I had just finished reading, but still tried to enter words quickly to avoid too much thinking.",
1201,after reading the stories for a moment I mostly thought of words that were related to the events in the story.,
1202,I felt disturbed,
1203,It felt a bit harder to come up with words to type.,
1204,I did not feel any differences.,
1205,I was writing some more dark words in the second round,
1206,I was acutely aware that my words may be different or influenced by the story,
1207,"I would use the same strategy as the first round, but I did use a lot of words associated with the story so I can reinforce it in my memory.",
1208,Various words related to the story popped into my head.,
1209,"I felt more inclined to think of words that tied back to various events or references of the story, such as sheriff and murder.",
1210,"I felt more crazy after reading the story, like I had gone mad.",
1211,,
1212,"The difference was that, before reading the story, i was remembering words on a rapid way. I was able to remember many of the words. After reading the story, however, remembering the words was a little difficult because it was like my mind was filled with the story. ",
1213,I did not feel any differences between the games.,
1214,I was a bit confused ,
1215,words from the story came to mind during the second word chain game,
1216,I found that it was easier to enter words because of the story that I read.,
1217,I think the story had little effect on my playing of the word chain game. The sex part of the story definitely had me thinking more about that type of stuff for a little while.,
1218,Initially I was having words from the story pop in my head so I made a conscious effort to free my mind.,
1219,"Before the story, I felt I had no direction of which words to use. After the story, I used words that came to mind after the story.",
1220,Maybe a little more gloomy and bleak after the story.,
1221,"i noticed that after reading the story i was actively avoiding using words i had just read, but was not always successful",
1222,,
1223,I was thinking more about environments such as the forest that Stuart and his friends were going through.,
1224,i had different words on my mind,
1225,felt like I was supposed to use words from the story,
1226,I know I was influenced to start with the word water because it was one of the last words in the story. The first time I think I did have a random word that I started with. I also felt like some of my word choices were influenced by the story - I remember at one point typing the word violence.,
1227,"The first time I felt regular, the second time I felt a little more charged up and eager to play",
1228,I noticed I used a lot of the words found in the story.,
1229,forgot most of the details in the story,
1230,I guess just more words came to mind so I could incorporate that in the second part,
1231,I didn't really notice any differences. I simply tried to focus on words each time.,
1232,Some words didn't what to use until more positive words could be used.,

1235,I was trying to construct a narrative more clearly,
1236,"I felt that the second game was influence by certain elements of the story,  at least initially.",
1237,I didn't notice any significant differences; I approached the game the same.,
1238,"The big difference I felt was that I seemed to be more highly focused on images from out of doors, and in particular I was thinking of the mountainous environment of the story, the spooky green pickup which followed the heroine, and the road on which they drove. The story definitely influenced my second round of the word chain game as images from it were fresh in my mind. This might be because I am personally very familiar with the Naches river and the highway which goes alongside it, since I have gone fishing and gold panning there many times! ",
1239,I was focused on the words or situations in the story,
1240,"After reading the story, I used words that were similar to the ones in that story",
1241,I felt like my words changed after reading the story. ,
1242,"My mind just wandered in the first, but in the second I could not get the story out of my mind. ",
1243,I felt a little more sad and lonely so that influenced the places that I thought of,
1244,I had less questions as to what was going to happen after I played the game the second time around. ,

1275,i wasn't trying to match words to the story or from the story after reading the story.,
1276,I might have used some words from the story the second time. I'm not sure. ,
1277,"I had the same ""strategy"" for the second round, but I did find that some words from the story were coming to mind more easily. There was more of a flow for some words without much effort on my end when I chose something loosely related to the story.",
1278,"My mind was full of thoughts about the story, which had an effect on the words I used.",
1279,"The first time around, I was just looking at my surroundings and using those words.  After reading the story, I had the story in my mind and so I was using words from that.",
1280,After reading the  story easy to write more words and easy to create it.,
