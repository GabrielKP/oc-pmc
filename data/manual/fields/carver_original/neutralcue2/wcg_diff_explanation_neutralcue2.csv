1145,Initially felt sad after reading the story but tried to put that feeling out of my mind using the words I typed in the word chain game,
1146,i felt my self more spontaneous in second round of word chain ,
1147,I wanted to  give responses other than words from the story.  While I did words from the story would pop in.,
1148,I went from a suspenseful and mysterious feeling to a concentrated and locked-in feeling.,
1149,just more negative overall ,
1150,The topics I thought of changed after reading the story and I found it easier to come up with words,
1151,"I definitely felt a little more engaged. I was already engaged before, but the story got me interested and left an impression on me going into the second word chain game. I would definitely say it was a little less boring, and I was a little less tired. It somewhat made it easier to come up with words since I related it to the story, however, that ran out sooner or later as I couldn't come up with anymore words.",
1152,"Like I mentioned before, the story had more of a darker tone so that is definitely reflected in the words that came to mind during round 2. They were definitely more related to the story than before when they were just kind of random or rhymed with one another. it was also a bit more difficult to come up with words the second time but i did not have a change in how tired or bored i felt at all.",
1153,I felt more focused. Less anxious about the word game probably because I had done it before but also I could use things from the story to help me come up with more words. ,
1154,I felt after reding the story the words were going to come quicker but they didn't.,
1155,"The changes I felt were all centered around my answers being darker, after reading the story I could only think of dark words that related to it. The idea of murder, death, and mystery kept popping into my mind while playing the game. This was obviously my brain dealing with the contents of the story.  ",
1156,i felt a little more sad after reading the story but nothing really changed. I quickly shifted my focus onto the things around my room and then i started picking up words from that. ,
1157,I noticed I was using words from the story. I was also choosing words related to themes in the story.,
1158,i felt angry for the dead girl and for her family from the story. wanted to know the rest of the story.,
1159,I felt pretty similar,
1160,mood switching ,
1161,"I felt a little more anxious playing the second time, thinking about the parts  I missed or misunderstood, not wanting to think about the sadder parts of the story and deflecting those thoughts during the second round",
1162,felt like i was in the story,
1163,I specifically felt a bit more uneasy after the story. I believe it was because I was able to understand Claire's feelings to an extent.,
1164,Some specific changes I felt was that I felt some unease as I played the word chain game the second time. Another change that I felt was that I was still feeling some uneasiness about the story such as suspense and apprehension.,
1165,,
1166,"I felt a lot more somber after reading the story as I can not help but think how much of it is really fiction, for this happens in our world, probably more than I like to think. Makes me feel more jaded as such a person would voluntarily do something this horrid and even worse that their spouse lets them get away with it just due their attachments. ",
1167,"i separate things very well, therefore it was easy for me to compartmentalize things",
1168,I felt the word game was fun way for me to come up with different things around me  ,
1169,I felt no change,
1170,I didn't really feel any specific changes.,
1171,i enjoyed the story allot and have never heard of it.The exercise was interesting and unusual,
1172,It's not that I didn't enjoy the story - I did - but I didn't not notice it bleeding into the word game. Once I finished the story - I just went back to picking complete random words.,
1173,"It was more difficult to come up with words, even if I stared at the keyboard the words wouldn't pop-up like before. I   felt heavy and bit like taken out of place like going from a dark room into a sunny field.",
1174,The second time felt somewhat more difficult to come up with words.,
1175,,
1176,I don't really have much to say. I don't have much to reflect. ,
1177,"fatigue, boredom, on edge, loss for words, quick thinking.",
1178,I felt physically on edge and was still thinking about the death in the story,
1179,After reading the story I felt less bored than before reading the story. I think coming up with words was a little bit easier. I was also very curious about the ending of the story. ,
1180,"I may have felt more sad, or more on edge than the first round which seemed to change the types of words I was using and coming up with them at a faster rate.",
1181,I think the above topics cover any changes I felt.,
1182,,
1183,I wanted to know how the story could have ended. I was quite nice and wonderful in my change of mood while reading the story. I was very calm while reading. It was an interesting one. I had to pay full attention in order to understand the picture and the context of the story.Â ,
1184,"I felt sadder, more tired, more depressed. I think the word choices I made reflected that for the most part. ",
1185,It was hard trying not to use words that I just read.,
1186,,
1187,,
1188,I just felt i wanted to know about the story more ,
1189,"As I wrote in a previous response, there was just kind of a heaviness about me in the second time through the word chain game. I don't know that my actual performance (in terms of number of words generated) was affected, but I felt less nimble while doing it. Part of my mind was still on the story I'd been reading.",
1190,I felt my thoughts were darker after reading the story. Gloomy... slightly depressing.,
1191,"they are hard to describe, just like extra words in my brain as Im trying to think of my own",
1192,finding the words came through whether it was easy and or difficult,
1193,"I felt neutral towards the story, it didn't give me any considerable emotion",
1194,"After reading the story, I was thinking of words and picturing things relating to the story during the second round. During the first round though, I was mostly thinking of words that had to do with my current surroundings and thoughts.",
1195,"i didn't think about the story again after it ended, i just continued on in my thoughts of what to type next",
1196,"Same as before, the only big change was thinking about water/river and things around it",
1197,I felt emotionally impacted. I felt invested in the story. I felt invested in her narrative. ,
1198,"There was a slight change in my words at the beginning of the second game. However, I shortly moved past the thoughts.",
1199,I felt emotionally changed in topic by the story but also did not feel like playing games.,
1200,"Even trying to avoid the influence of the story, when I thought of a word that was associated with crime, justice, honesty, or nature for example, I wondered how much of these words were a result of the story's influence on me. Some words felt emotional, whereas in the first round, emotion was mostly lacking.",
1201,when playing the word chain game the first time I came up with completely random words. while reading the story i thought about how these types of things happen. during the second word chain game at the beginning i used words that were either from the story or related to the content.,
1202,The game took my mind off of the story,
1203,It felt difficult to come up with words because I was trying to think about what happened during the story. The word game was pretty boring too.,
1204,"I did not feel any changes. The word chain game, felt the same.",
1205,I definitely felt like I was choosing more somber words in the second round than in the first round of the game. I didn't notice any changes in energy or boredom while playing either of the games. And the difficulty felt the same for both rounds.,
1206,"I felt unsure if I was being affected by the story- I wanted to write randomly, and I feel I did, but I was also very curious as to whether there was anything subconscious going on",
1207,"I was just more actively engaged in the game because I was trying to recall events and elements and incorporate them into the game itself. There was just more of a mental effort as I connected the story with the game. In some ways the game became easier because I had a recent list to draw from, until I ran out and had to rely on old strategies.",
1208,"It was easier overall to come up with words, but I felt that it was difficult to come up with original words that were unrelated to the story. I felt it easier to just come up with words as they came to mind, and the story greatly influenced that.",
1209,"As mentioned before, I mostly found myself thinking of words and objects that could be relevant to the story or adjacent to it.",
1210,I felt more enraged and irritated after reading the story and it affected the words I came up with in the second word game.,
1211,Nothing change,
1212,"At some point, i felt tired playing the game because i had typed almost all the words that had come to my mind. Also, i felt  bored because it was like words that are already typed were the one re-occuring in my mind.",
1213,I do not feel like there were any specific changes for me. I was able to quickly focus my attention from the story to the word game.,
1214,It was a bit confused ,
1215,The word chain game felt tedious. ,
1216,The only change I felt after reading the story was how easy it was to make up words during the word chain game. It came very easily for me. I felt that the topic was more dark while thinking of words for the word chain game. I felt that it was from the story I read beforehand. ,
1217,I didn't have any difficulties dividing my thoughts from the story and the word game. I found that once I finished the second word chain game I was thinking of the end of the story more intensely.,
1218,"It's a dark story, a downer of a story so naturally that was felt when I started throwing words out there. I was thinking, darkness, forest, I live in the city so forest is very not me but I pictured that vividly.",
1219,"It was an interesting experience. Again, the story just absorbed me and my mind. It was all I could think of while doing the second word chain game.",
1220,,
1221,the story i guess had a bit of an emotional draining feeling on my mind that made the word chain game seem tedious and trite--it was definitely a chore to come up with words the second time,
1222,"There is no difference on how I felt, just that I tried to have some emotions about the scenario.",
1223,It was more of a vivid depiction of environments and locations that came to mind during/after reading through the story. After reading it lingered in my mind more and I thought about a few of the locations presented.,
1224,Mostly I just kept jumping to words or things mentioned in the story when i ran out of immediate connections. it would just opo up into my head like beer or creek or something.,
1225,"Not sure how to anwer this, it was a feeling not thoughts or anythig that can be easily described",
1226,"It was more difficult to do the second time, I got tripped up on a couple words. As previously mentioned, I think the story influenced some of the paths my associations took after reading the story.",
1227,"Like I said I felt a bit more charged up and eager to play, but honestly I just wanted to read more about what was going on between Claire and Stuart",
1228,Just more focused on the story and the why of it all.,
1229,,
1230,I think it was easiest to play the 2nd part as I already had words in my mind to use instead of having to pause to think of more like in the 1st round.,
1231,I didn't notice many changes. Both times I was trying to ignore distractions so I could do the game properly. The story was just another distraction.,
1232,Desire to think of positive words after the story.,
1233,"I just felt annoyed. That was my experience. I wanted to read the story till the end, at least I thought it would end but   it did not. So yes my mood definitely did change.",
1234,I felt a little difficulty not repeating the same words from round of the word chain task ,
1235,I didn't really experience that,
1236,I felt that my mind was naturally wandering towards certain words related to aspects of the story.,
1237,I didn't experience any specific changes as I played the word game the second time. I believe I used many of the same words/connections as I did the first time. ,
1238,"As I have said, I am very familiar with the geographical area of this story in real life, so I had a very different feeling when completing the second word chain game. It was a combination of nostalgia and a kind of headiness, and also some low level anxiety when thinking about the highway and the man in the truck following Claire. ",
1239,It was an interesting story. I was vested in finding out what would happen,
1240,"Before reading the story, I used sports as the topic to build off of. After the story, I used words such as murder, death, river, etc. The story influenced the word game for me.",
1241,I was more focused on my reaction while reading the story. ,
1242,I really was stuck on Claires husband being responsible for the girls death with his friends. ,
1243,It changed from more positive memories to more sad and lonely memories,
1244,"My feelings would change depending on if the word derived from the story I read or if I pulled it out of the ether. If it came from the story, there was an emotional connotation that existed within the context of the story. ",
1245,I felt much more on edge for the second run through.,
1246,I felt tired thinking of words to use. other than that my emotions were about the same.,
1247,I didn't feel any changes,
1248,"I felt engaged and engrossed in the second round word chain because of the story I read. I was writing about my feelings about having read the story years ago, not about the narrative of So Much Water So Close To Home itself. Also, how much I love Carver's work and how he wrote my favorite poem called ""Morning, Thinking of Empire.""",
1249,The only change is that I wanted it to be over fast so I could get to the questions,
1250,"At first, in doing the word game... it was a bit boring. I found myself looking for things to write about. But, I enjoyed the word game very much after reading the story. I had something to do as an outlet to process what I'd read. I was thankful for a tool (the word game) to do just that.",
1251,I felt more anxious and sad,
1252,"I felt distressed by the story and very sympathetic to Claire, who reacted the same way I would if my husband had behaved in such a fashion. I had trouble getting the idea of the water out of my head, and trouble directing myself away from just repeating words from the story over and over again. Near the end of the second round I noticed I began to feel tired.",
1253,"I think I was just wondering, by the time I got to the second chain game, what  was the point of this study.",
1274,I felt so calm and enjoyed playing the word chain game.,
1275,There was a change in my thoughts. But I was still trying to choose words that had nothing at all to do with the story. I was trying to separate them both in my mind.,
1276,,
1277,"When I played the first round of the game, I began with ""dog"" because I had spent the morning taking care of and playing with my dog. She was top of mind when I sat down to begin. Several of the words I chose for that round were things that had happened today or were just generally on my mind. In the second round, I had the additional words from the story on my mind so that influenced some of my word choices - especially towards the beginning of the game.",
1278,"I felt sort of haunted by the story, and also by the selfishness of the man involved and how he reminded me of the men in my family growing up. I was sort of blasted by unpleasant memories of them, while also thinking about what it must have been like for Claire to be married to such a person. ",
1279,The only real change I felt is that I was focused on something completely different (the story) the second time around.,
1280,none.,
1281,"Like I said, the story's images were on my mind at the beginning of the 2nd game. But I also noticed I was a bit bored and I didn't want to just repeat the same words I came up with in the 1st game, so I took more time to think of new words to add on.",
1282,I felt more grounded and less open minded towards worse I could list. I couldn't come up with random words as readily.,
1283,I just felt like the story was in the back of my mind. ,
1284,"If there were any changes, I was not consciously aware of them. The story, while very well written and engaging, did not impact my word chain exercises to any degree that I was cognizant of.",
1859,The story keeps on playing in my mind,
