1254,I was trying not to but I ended up looking around me to think of objects to write. I tried to think of words that were related in some way but spaced apart to not form sentences unintentionally. After I read the story I found myself thinking of many words that I had just read.,
1255,"I tried to think of words that had been part of my day, i.e I started a fire so contributed log. I also defaulted to looking around the room. Lastly, I thought of words that impacted my last few days, and came up with earthquake.",
1256,"think of thoughts that come stream of conscious, look at my keyboard and the letters",
1257,I tried to look around the room and name things and name anything that was related to those things. I just kept thinking of different topics and different words that could be associated. ,
1258,"I've heard of a few different variations of this game, so I am not sure if I played it properly. In school we would play it with choosing a word such as ""Apple"" and then starting the next work with the last letter of the previous word, so ""E"" words. The way I chose to play was to type in a random word to start and just whatever I immediately thought of based off the first is what I would type next. I found this to be more enjoyable because it was right off the top of the brain.",
1259,rereading ,
1260,I started with a word relevant to what I could see from where I was sitting. I visualized that word and created a scene surrounding it. The first word I could see in the scene is what I typed,
1261,i just would type a word and try to think of the first word that popped in my head that was related to the previous word,
1262,I would think of a word and list off words related to that word or experience. When i ran out of things that came to mind i would pick a new random word and list off more random words related to the new word.,
1263,"Well, I made a mistake in the first part and created sentences; for the second part, however, I did associations. So some words created chains from the words before them. ",
1264,meaning of words,
1265,"Confused at first, second round I realized it was related and I tried my best listing off anything relevant to the sentence. Anything relating to companies, cleaning, etc. ",
1266,I looked around the room and went from there,
1267,"I wrote what first came into my mind, but also drifted towards things I'd like to be doing at the moment",
1268,I tried to pick the next word with a combination in mind.,
1269,i tried using regular and simple words,
1270,Tried to think of different words that were related and unrelated. Tried not to have too many words from the same category or that started with the same letter,
1271,I'd just a pick a word and that would lead me to think of related words in a stream of consciousness. ,
1272,I had no strategy. I just listed words as they come into my thoughts.,
1273,"I try to relate the first word to the topic, then go through the words in the same topic before jumping to another one. ",
1285,Try to think of a word,
1286,I just looked around at first then I imagined different rooms and named things from there.,
1287,I did not have any strategies while playing word chain.,
1288,I just looked around the room,
1289,I thought of words that made me happiest.,
1290,"Noticing things in the room in my line of sight, picturing something in my mind and thinking what else would be near that thing",
1291,I would think of a specific place and generate words that had to do with the place.,
1292,I let words randomly come to my mind. ,
1293,tried words that were similar and rhymed at times,
1294,none,
1295,None. I just came up with words and then thought about whatever word come closest.,
1296,Just tried to think of different yet related things,
1297,I didn't really have strategies. I typed the first words I thought of until I hesitated a bit at a point and then had to think.,
1298,"just went with whatever went to my head, I'm very scatterbrain and think of unrelated things mostly, I very much just have random thoughts all the time, so I just imputed whatever thoughts pop to mine immediately, though my mind wanders between objects, things frequently ",
1299,"I just read it, no extraordinary strategy",
1300,there were no particular strategies,
1301,Free flowing word association,
1302,"Mainly thinking of any objects in front of me, the recent earthquake events in NJ and themes from the short  story.",
1303,"free association -- choose a word, type the first thought that occurs",
1304,Naming things I can see or imagine nearby.,
1305,The aplhapebt Firest letter of each word is nexr letter in alphabet,
1306,I just thought of scenes from the story. ,
1307,thinking of compound words,
1308,I just let my mind move naturally and came up with my own thoughts about what followed the words ,
1309,I may have thought of words after typing others in the box. Typing one led me to think of another many times. ,
1310,I used both the sound of words and the meaning of words in both word chain game rounds. ,
1311,"None used, just thought freely about words",
1312,"while i'm at work, while sitting at my desk, just things around me in general.",
1313,Tried using words that somewhat was relatable to each other,
1314,I just typed words that popped into my mind. I looked around and thought of different things.,
1315,nothing just thought of something that came to my mind first.,
1316,"Not really any, just name things I see in my surronding",
1317,I HAD TO TYPE WORDS WITH THE SAME LINE,
1318,just looking at stuff around me,
1319,"no strategies, just association",
1320,"I just listed words as they came to mind. I did not make sentences, just tried to be creative.",
1321,No strategies,
1322,I just wrote the first word that came to mind.,
1323,just my brain,
1324,I looked around my room for any close by objects for ideas.,
1325,just recall,
1326,"Just whatever popped in my head. And some times, follow with the word just used.",
1327,"I did not use any strategies, just thought of words and wrote them down",
1328,"I tried to think of more interesting words but I often resorted to similar words, rhyming words, and related words.",
1329,just typ-ed what popped in my heqad.,
1330,"In the first round of the word chain game, I looked at my surroundings and tried to think of words based on the objects. In the second round, I listed off words that I remembered from reading the passage and also in combination with random words that came to my mind. Some of those words were also based on my surroundings. ",
1331,I would choose words that rhymed and were variations of each other and went with the first thing that came to mind.,
1332,"when I was out of ideas i would look around the room I am in, and then associate that word with some other word that is closely related ",
1333,"words that came to my mind in the first one, in the second one I just thought of the passage I read",
1334,"I tried to think of words I could easily use to continue the chain, rather than the first ones that came to mind",
1335,"I thought of words, and also came up with words by looking around the room I'm in. After that, I just wrote words that connected and came to my head quickly.",
1336,I relied mostly on word association and starting with one particular letter.,
1337,Strategy I used was thinking of words that were associated with each other.,
1338,"I tried to use the previous word only to get to the next one, even if that makes the chain as a whole kind of nonsensical. Like a ""before and after"" puzzle on Wheel of Fortune.",
1339,I would look for objects around me or experiences close to me when I ran out of random words.,
1340,Just went with a stream of consciousness,
1341,none,
1342,I made word associations based on previous words as a way to quickly think of new words.,
1343,"None, just whatever came to mind.",
1344,Thinking about everything in the environment ,
1345,I didn't have a strategy,
1346,Nothing. I went with flow-of-thought,
1347,At first was doing colors then words that went together but not sentences. ,
1348,"I just recalled words I have seen while reading, rhymes, and synonyms",
1349,thinking about everyday life and fitting everything together,
1350,imaging good words,
1351,Whatever word came to mind next,
1352,"I was mainly naming any objects in my room or any objects I was recently thinking about. Once I read the story, the next word chain game had words from that story, since those words were fresh in my mind. I was also naming objects or items that are related to each other in some of the words. I was also trying to use word meanings to help me think of words too. ",
1353,I used stream of thought,
1354,I picked items near me when I got stuck.,
1355,"I initially thought of things I had been thinking of prior to participating in the study, also I was thinking of words that  came to mind upon having begun my participation today, the study and the story influenced my responses. Also, my surrounding environment, the room I was in and objects there were used as words I added. ",
1356,none,
1357,rhyming,
1358,let my mind wander and looked out the french doors at my cattle in the field - then did word associations,
1359,just looking around and naming anything i could think of ,
1360,i tried to think of similar things to it and move through without repeating it.,
1361,no strategy please,
1362, One of the most important strategies is to have a wide-ranging vocabulary. Knowing words from various categories and with different letter combinations can help you find suitable words for any situation.,
1363,I just read stuff around me and named the things that were around me,
1364,I tried to choose generic words.,
1365,I did not have any strategies.,
1366,just following the chain of thought,
1367,The next word was either another word that was similar to the word I just used or something that I thought of because of the other word. ,
1368,used similar words or associated words,
1369,I looked around the room for items I could use ,
1370,"Reading the passage, I'm struck by its haunting atmosphere and the sense of detachment with which the events are described. The narrative presents a group of individuals who stumble upon a deceased girl caught in branches over a river. There's a sense of eerie calmness as they deliberate what to do, eventually deciding to set up camp and continue with their activities, interspersed with casual mentions of drinking whiskey.",
1371,First thing that came to mind,
1372,I studied the words very carefully by making sure I will bring up a word that will fetch me more sequence.,
1373,"Let my mind wander, going word-by-word, typing in the first thing that my mind associated with the previous word.",
1374,"i just wrote random words, then found words that connected each word",
1375,the first time I was just randomly thinking of words  and the second time I was trying to use the last letter of the previous word to help me think of a word,
1376,I JUST WROTE RANDOM WORDS THAT CAME TO MY MIND,
1377,I used word association after choosing a random word to begin with.,
1378,"For the first one I thought of my surroundings and started going through things in my house room by room. I allowed myself to branch out for example with the animals. For the second one, I used a similar strategy but I used the story that we had read as inspiration for part of it to try and avoid reusing words. If I got stuck, I did reuse some words until I could find my way back.",
1379,I said what item showed in my mind and what I saw around me.,
1380,I simply wrote what came to mind and what is in my environment.,
1381,"Used words that were similar in nature, or similar in spelling (eg. same first letter)",
1382,Word association - choosing similar words,
1383,I just went along with whatever words came into my mind randomly.,
