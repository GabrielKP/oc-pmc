1069,"I was interested in how the story ends, but also tried to focus m y mind on the word chain game wand keep it out of my mind",
1150,,
1194,A few words from the story came to mind but other than that it was the same,
1200,The biggest change was the topic of the words. I used words like murder and assault and other darker words in the second game. The first game was just random every day words. ,
1223,Some of the words that came through were darker in tone.  Also noticed that I was more bored because typing random words for 3 minutes straight is not particularly interesting.,
1224,Nothing,
1225,It was very interesting and educative,
1226,It was easier to find words and the images in my mind were less random and more scenes from the story,
1227,It was interesting period at first I didn't know how everything would correlate.,
1228,There were definitely a shift of positivity to more of a hyperfocus on anger and sadness on my side after reading the story that I noticed. but that's mainly based off of trying to come up with other types of words and topics to input rather than try to copy or mimic what I did in the first game,
1229,I was tired of typing by that point,
1230,"I just felt like I couldn't clear my mind as much.  I kept picturing things in my head from the story.  While trying to think about words just randomly, I couldn't feel random anymore.",
1231,"I felt like it was more difficult to come up with words. I felt like the first word chain was easy to come up with stuff. I felt like my mind was clear and almost a happy-go-lucky feeling. The second word chain wasn't like that. My mind felt a little heavy. Not tired, but just full of thoughts. So I had to force myself to come up with words. I physically wasn't able to look around the room, or I didn't want to. I was still thinking of the passage, so to come up with words I had to look at my keyboard and come up with words from the letters I saw, because I was processing what I read, if that makes sense.",
1232,"It was hard to detach from the story and, thus, more difficult to think creatively and freely to form words.",
1233,I was able to think of words faster,
1234,The words I used were more reflective of the story I read versus the first round,
1235,I had more of a subconscious focus on negative things and death. I also felt like my stream of word choices went much faster in the second trial.,
1236,The story did not significantly impact my thoughts or emotions. I did notice that I struggled to come up with words for the word chain game.,
1237,"The story made it take up space in my head when I needed that space to type words. Because of this, I found it slightly harder to concentrate.",
1238,"I felt less able to focus during the second round, like my brain was still processing the story I read.",
1239,"The story definitely changed my mood, because it was a somber chain of events. However, I don't think my mood really changed how I played the word association game.",
1240,I was just thinking about the story and I was like I can use some of the words I learn in the story for the word change.  Plus I was trying to think what the story is all about.,
1241,I was thinking about the story when I was doing the second word chain so I used words from the story or the setting of the story to make the second word chain easier. I didn't have very strong or weak feelings after reading the story; I was mostly focused and intrigued.,
1242,It was hard not to associate the word game with the story and it was frustrating at times but it faded with time.,
1243,I enjoyed this game,
1244,still thinking how the story ended,
1245,nice experience given the study,
1246,As I said before not entirely sure how much it affected me but maybe it made me pick slightly more grim words sometimes.,
1247,The only thing was trying to think of words that I hadn't used before in the first word chain.,
1248,Thank you,
1249,nothing for now,
1250,I felt it was easy to come up with emotional words versus regular words. My descriptive words became more intuitve.,
1251,I felt that after reading the story I was able to think of words easier. I was able to focus on the task better because I felt more engaged with the task.,
1252,Nothing special,
1253,"I felt robotic entering in the words, especially because I was told to just write words and not string sentences together with the words",
1254,I felt pretty moved by the story which made the the second game slightly difficult for me.,
1255,stress,
1256,After reading the story I found that part of the time I thought of words that were used in the story,
1257,"Apart from being influenced by my choice of words after being immersed in the story, there was no other experience.",
1258,"I was disturbed, sad, and felt nervous while reading. These feeling grew as the story unfolded. I was also left with questions, and a desire to read it again.",
1259,i felt fine all the way through ,
1260,"I noticed that I felt a little more down after reading the story, probably because I wanted to know how it ended and wasn't sure if there was more to it. I did not feel bored or tired afterward. Other than noticing myself thinking more of words reltaed to water, I didn't have any emotional changes.",
1261,"Well, i just felt a little bit brighter. There was this ginger i had",
1262,I didn't feel any changes. ,
1263,"I struggled to come up with items to write during the first game, which is why I focused on objects directly near me or in my house. Reading the story line by line really helped to cement it in my memory, as I was able to focus on each action of the characters. The story was on my mind throughout the entire second game, which is where almost all of my entries originated from. My emotional state was intrigued and a bit sad after reading the story. ",
1264,It was a little easier to think of words after reading the story because of all the words i had just read. Also kept think of the story while i was playing the game.,
1265,,
1266,"I did not feel any changes in my feelings or mood and even though I kept thinking of the story without wanting to, I simply kept writing whatever words came to mind.",
1267,"I first started typing about birds which transitioned into me talking about how New Jersey is nicer than Washington state. I did have a change in the topics that came to mind, mid word game.  I recently moved from NJ to WA so it's a thought that's been reoccurring. I miss New Jersey. I feel homesick. Washington kind of stinks.",
1268,I was thinking about water and the story slightly more.,
1269,I didn't feel really any emotions or changes.  I was just trying to comprehend the story and then think of words that I could use in the word chain.  That was what I was focusing on.  ,
1270,Ver good experience while doing word chain game. Very interesting concept for engaged.,
1271,"I don't think I felt any specific change. Again, I note that I definately realized that I was thinking of the story during the second chain game, but that is all I can say about it. ",
1272,just felt more at peace and words came faster to me ,
1273,"I basically thought about the emotions that our narrator probably felt, the way she experienced things, etc. and became more engaged in the second word chain as i thought more deeply on the subject at mind.",
1274,"I wanted to know more about the story and what happened, i was worried about Claire and was wondering what was going to happen to them.",
1275,While reading the story I was emotionally connected by curiosity.  I wondered how the story would end and it felt like a cliffhanger.  When completing the word games I focused more on creating words than the story.  ,
1276,"The story almost got me a little bit irritated and mad because of how idiotic or careless or reckless the woman's husband was. For what I was reading in the story, it seemed like he and his friends discovered a dead body of a naked girl and didn't report it because they just wanted to enjoy their trip. But how overly pragmatic he was about it got me irritated. I was picturing a classic middle aged guy that doesn't really care about much and just drinks his problems away and solicit sex from his semi unwilling wife.  He doesn't really seem to care that much that he discovered the naked and I think decapitated body of a girl. I don't know if it made my ability to recount words better or worse, but it probably did change my thinking process.",
1277,,
1278,"Again, I noticed I was a bit more hungry. Definitely more bored.",
1279,I didnt feel many changes,
1280,"I feel like I was more aware and focused on the word chain game after the store. That story always unsettles me when I read it, I have the book on my bedside table, and this time was no different- I was unsettled and more alert. I think this made me more able to focus on finding a variety of words rather than using things I saw.",
1281,it was good,
1282,"I felt I was feeling more negative thoughts during the second game.  The story took a dark turn, and that seemed to influence my word choices.  I felt a bit unsettled after the story, a bit restless.",
1283,The only change I felt was that I was thinking of words from the story in the word game.,
1284,I was much more aware of where the words came from because the story was still on my mind. The words came to me easier and I was aware of how the words connected to each other. I was invested more in the word chain the second time and the words came easy.,
1285,I felt great and happy ,
1286,I think that I may have unknowingly used some words from the story that I did not realize until answering these questions.,
1287,I had a good expierience. I did the work. Thats all.,
1288,I think maybe a few words at the beginning I thought of came from the story but then I think I thought of different ones. Thank you.,
1289,I did not feel any changes during the word chain game after reading the story.,
1290,I think I felt like I could come up with words better and it was easier for me to pick a certain topic and stick with it instead of trying to find all kinds of words to come up with like I did in the first round.,
1291,I didn't notice any changes,
1292,It was easy to use words from the story ,
1293,I focused on the story and I thought about the things happened in the story. I also though about end of the story. ,
1294,"I was not bored in playing the word game. It was a challenge to try and find words taht I could use for this activity. I welcomed the challenge. My mind was mostly tying to think of unique words, that at times were unrelated to one another",
1295,I had a great time with this study or survey ,
1296,"I just felt more aware of myself than before. But I think it was because I was trying to clear my mind of the story as to ""not focus"" for the word chain.",
1297,I felt more inclined to defend women because our voice is usually silenced.,
1298,Frightened.,
1299,Just more on edge. Trying to avoid dark options. ,
1300,I felt off after reading a story about sensitive subject matter not expecting it to be like it was. It was easier to think of words at the beginning of the story versus the end after reading it,
1301,I think it got easier to come up with words for the word chain game after reading the short story simply because it warmed up my brain to read for a few minutes.,
1302,I may have had trouble coming up with random words even after I read the story.,
1303,I just felt like I was following a line of thought with the words I used and how I can connect them. Part of the words in the beginning started with the story and by the end I was in my own world.,
1304,"It had me questioning the reason for the story, which affected me a little during the questions.",
1305,It was kind of boring. I feel like if it had some sound attached it would be more interesting.,
1306,The whole incident was playing in my mind and I wanted to know how it ended,
1307,I felt strong sadness about the murder of the young girl.,
1308,"The first round, I thought of my life. The second round, I thought of the story. Some words were the same since it was a story that could be relatable to some. However, the changes were in my train of thought, not my emotions.",
1309,After reading the story I felt a little more dark because the story was a bit disturbing. I think the words I came up with in the second round may have reflected that feeling.,
1310,"The specific changes I felt were that my brain was more alert and exercised, so coming up with random words in a short period of time felt relatively more easier. ",
1311,a positive one.,
1312,I definitely felt it was harder to focus on the second word chain because I was still processing the story I just read.,
1313,"I felt like I had another topic to pull from the second time around, focusing on events from the story I just read",
1314,,
1315,"I felt a little uneasy not knowing the ending of the story. I felt the most unease when the story jumped around from scene to scene, I was emotionally invested in Clair's safety and I felt left in the dark about how she actually handled the situations that she was experiencing.",
1316,The story had no impact on how I played the game. So there were no changes to write about here.,
1317,I did not experience any difference in how I felt while playing the word game following the story. ,
1318,"It was a interesting, engaging story. It was vivid enough that I didn't have much trouble pulling words for the second word game.",
1319,I felt changes of relaxing and thinking to see what I should write or remember when asked.,
1320,"I just felt more focused on trying to associate words. I was really engaged in the story, so when the word chain game came up I think I was still in that state.",
1321,In the first word chain I struggled to come up with words and had to rely on a strategy to stay engaged for 3 minutes just writing random words. I actually use this tactic when I'm trying to fall asleep so it got REALLY tiresome. After the story I had a strong context and vivid imagery I could draw on to come up with words (I also didn't have to come up with that many words because I was just writing back things that came to mind from the story I'd just read).,
1322,"Like I said previously, there was not really a change at all. I personally don't think there was, because I was just thinking of words to provide for the game. It didn't have anything to do with the story.",
1323,"I didn't feel anything, I read a story and then pretty much moved on in about 30 seconds",
1324,"It was difficult to follow and remember a story that was not a constant stream of words. It is hard to concentrate When it is broken into fragments like that and the wording is jumbled a bit or lacks sense in parts. It was a disturbing story, but no one seemed to be too disturbed by the happenings in it- so that was jogging as well.",
1325,"I felt almost distracted by only the story and couldn't really put myself in a different setting other than the story. I felt like some details were filled in by my own gathering of the story and had some slight questions that were sort of answered. I also found Claire and Stuart's relationship a little off and weird. Almost like she doesn't fully love him or trust him, but tolerates him for their son. It was really off, but engaging and interesting.",
1326,I think I felt sadder after the story. My words may have reflected that during the second round.,
1327,"My experience was that these were tasks that were changing in topic from a word chain game to a story back to a word chain game. I didnt really feel or experience much of a change other than the topic, my mind moved from one task to the next. ",
1328,I didn't feel any different changes regarding playing after the second time around.,
1329,just normal feelings nothing more ,
1330,I felt very slightly more effort bringing words to mind after spending time reading the story. I noticed more words were related to the story.,
1331,"For the first game I was just thinking about words. For the second game I was still thinking about words, but I was also thinking about the story. I wasn't intentionally thinking about it, but it was still on my mind.",
1332,"I didn't experience any changes. I was just focused on the game, and the story had no impact on my mood or emotions.",
1333,I was definitely more tired playing the word game the second time around. I was also tired of thinking of words to type. I did feel slightly distracted from the contents of the story and not knowing the ending.,
1334,"This experiment is quite interesting and educative, Thanks",
1335,"It was hard to come up with words in the first part, the story was deeply moving and depressing for me, and then I breezed through the second word chain game.",
1336,"Again, it was more about trying to both play the game and continuously come up with words, while also trying to think about the story in a more visual and spatial way to remember it better.",
1337,I did not feel any specific changes.,
1338,"I only felt a bit bored by the time the second word chain ""game"" came along.",
1339,"After reading the story, the specific changes I felt were a recollection of the story. As I was typing in new words, I caught myself thinking of the story and wondering what happened. I got frustrated that I couldn't recall the entire story from a single word and wanted to know more. ",
1340,I felt stressed and scared for some reason. I was left with questions that made my mind go back to the story. I felt more anxious.,
1341,"I think I felt more distracted playing the word game. I wouldn't call it harder or easier, just different. I think if the story had been less complex and happier, it would have been easy to dismiss in my mind and play the word game better.",
1342,I felt good and positive,
1343,I felt no change. Both word chains were equal to me.,
1344,I just felt like i was part of the story very intrigued into it. ,
1345,i was chill beforfe and afterwards i was more reflective and deep and personal ,
1346,Part of me was thinking about the story but I was also able to type in random words for the game that I don't think had anything to do with the story.,
1347,"I really didn't notice any changes, even though the story was (and still is) in my mind.",
1348,"I simply felt a bit more distracted while thinking about the story. I didn't find it either easier or harder to come up with the words. I just used different words, on average.",
1349,I felt sad going through the stories,
1350,"After a while, my mind went to, ""how much longer will this be.""  Then I kept typing.",
1351,"I felt more emotionally charged and angry at the story and sorry for Claire and the woman who died. It got me thinking on my own experience as a woman and my distrust of men. I feel like I was less distracted and able to get more words in, and the time went faster.",
1352,No. It is same,
1353,"I was a lot sadder the second time around, I had to keep my mind focused on the present instead of the past.",
1354,"I just felt like my fingers were getting a little tired from the repetitive typing without any breaks, also was running out of words to come up with on the fly (needed more inspiration) ",
1355,good ,
1356,"As soon as I began reading the excerpt, I recognized it as something I'd read before. After finishing, I was mainly disgusted by how the men in the story acted and empathized with the Claire character. I was grossed out by how she is basically unhappily servicing her husband the whole story in spite of his silencing and pawing at her constantly. None of the thoughts were specifically about the word game.",
1357,I felt much more melancholy and sad. The story was sad.,
1358,I specifically felt myself thinking about death and murder more than I was previously. This is reflected in my word choice during the word chain game.,
1359,I just felt sadness from the story.  The story was overall ending sad.  I wanted to know more about what happened to everyone.,
