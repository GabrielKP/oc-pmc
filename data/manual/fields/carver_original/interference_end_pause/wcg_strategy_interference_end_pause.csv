1069,What was in front of me and on my mind.,
1150,I didn't use any strategies.,
1194,Didn't use any,
1200,I just looked around my room when I ran out of words to give and chained it from there. ,
1223,Looking at letters on the keyboard and thinking of random words starting with that letter.,
1224,Related word,
1225,I used both the meaning and sound of words,
1226,letting one word lead to another,
1227,To think of as many words as possible,
1228,There was no strategy implemented when I was typing. I just type on what I could feel and sense as I close my eyes and begin to type.,
1229,I categorized some words but didn't really have much of a strategy honestly.,
1230,Just trying to clear my mind and write any random word that came into my head.,
1231,"I looked around the room and found items that I could see or think of. The second time, I looked at the keyboard and saw words that I could form from using beginning letters.",
1232,I just thought of words that came to my mind.,
1233,just what ever word popped up first,
1234,I just thought of words that describe things that interest me or that I recently read.,
1235,I just typed what instantly entered my mind.,
1236,Sometimes I entered a chain of words that began with the same letter.,
1237,I just kept typing whatever word popped into my head,
1238,"I just let my mind go from word to word. When I got stuck, I had to think for a second or two to find a word related to the one I just typed, but for the most part, the words just flowed.",
1239,"I just thought of objects close to me, objects that I encountered recently, and then tried to think of words that were related",
1240,I was thinking of just thinking of starting the word with the last letter of the current word.,
1241,"When I thought of a specific word, after entering it, I thought of similar words and entered them after.",
1242,I was just looking around the room and thinking about the story and just mentioning random words that popped into my head.,
1243,remembering the serial,
1244,thinking what is easy and familiar,
1245,nice game and very interesting,
1246,Sometimes I would try to think of words that started with the same letter just to give me way to think of words,
1247,"Nothing, just any word that came to mind",
1248,Nothing special,
1249,no did not use any ,
1250,I didn't have any real strategies. Just thought about my life and what was happening. ,
1251,I didn't really have a strategy other than making sure to avoid making sentences.,
1252,Awesome,
1253,Looking around the room and seeing things in my immediate vicinity ,
1254,I was slightly focused on the sound of the words.,
1255,Randomly ,
1256,"looked around the room for inspiration, pictured what's outside for inspiration, let my mind wander until a word popped into it",
1257,"I was writing down sequence of words that seems common, directly or indirectly related to itself.",
1258,"Some were simply images that popped into my head, and I think the second round was more emotionally triggered. However, I believe some words were completely random, and no thought triggered them.",
1259,i just wrote whatever came to mind ,
1260,"I tried not to use words that were related to each other, at least not all the time. I tried to use words that were different from each other.",
1261,"Well, everything came randomly to my head",
1262,I looked around the room for things to type.,
1263,"The first time I played, I mostly described objects in my immediate vicinity. The second time, my mind was almost entirely on the story I just read.",
1264,I just wrote whatever word I thought of first. Each word made me think of another.,
1265,"I was looking around the room, thinking about things I did today, and picking letters and making words up that start with that letter. ",
1266,I just wrote whatever word came to mind.,
1267,i didn't quite understand it at first but I think I understood what you wanted with the word chain game. I first started with words that are just associated with one another and then i transitioned to sentences in a chain. not sure if thats what you wanted. the directions didn't really ellaborate.,
1268,"no strategies, just the first word to come to mind",
1269,Just randomly thinking of words in my life and things going on around me,
1270,"none... the words striking in my head, so entered those words for word chain game",
1271,"not sure I would call it a strategy, but I tended to cluster words in categories, ie. animals.. rooms in a house... colors etc...",
1272,just thinking of things in my head or objects around me ,
1273,"i randomly thought of words, then elaborated on the category that word was based on to produce more words (ex: car = motor vehicle, so boat, train, trolley, etc). Then, for phase 2, i used words that came up when i thought of the story. I looked around the room and thought of what words described me to come up with initial words.",
1274,"The first round i looed at things around me and things that came to mind, the second round the story was fresh in my mind and i focused more on those words to add to what was around me.",
1275,I would think of a word and build on that word.  I used words that rhymed with the word selected.  I also used my space to come up with words to type.  ,
1276,"I use the multitude of strategies when playing the word chain game. Sometimes I would look for certain letters in the previous word that I wrote and chain different words off of that. Other times I would write words that kind of rhyme or have another type of broad semblances to me in pertinence to the existing word. Like if I thought of the word exterminate, it would make me think of eliminate eradicate annihilate, electrocute, things like that. Or if I thought of the word sharp, it might make me think of metals, a metal cleaver, or other things like that. Sometimes random words pop into my head too.",
1277,Nothing in particular,
1278,"grouping words together, like food items",
1279,looked around the room I was in,
1280,"I definitely looked around me a bit to think of words I could use easily (it's definitely easier than forcing your mind to find words). Then I tried not to rely on that as much and instead pivoted to thinking about words that I like, words that I find I enjoy the sound of, and that was harder but somehow more enjoyable, too.",
1281,none,
1282,I picked random words while looking around the room.,
1283,I used one word to think of other similar words. If I couldn't think of a word I used something around me.,

1291,none,
1292,Memory ,
1293,not really,
1294,Sometimes I would try to use dissasociated words. It would have been easy to type sentences one word a ta time. I ttired not to do that,
1295,rhymes ,
1296,"I don't think I used any strategies, though it is hard to say for sure if I did it without thinking about it.",

1312,"I looked around the room and would think of a category and go based off that, as well as use my imagination.",

1316,I mainly looked at objects around me in this room.,

1319,I just read the best I could and then answered to the best of my ability.,
1320,Just word association in general. That led to me putting myself in a corner where I could not think of a good association that made sense. ,
1321,The first time I started with alphabetical fruit but it got too difficult and I just started going with words that were in alphabetical order. The second time I just thought of things that were from the story and did word association until I was stuck. Then I wrote some words related to the task until I clicked back into things related to the story itself.,
1322,"Thought of things around me, and the things that are located outside.",
1323,I just looked around the room and wrote things I saw,
1324,"I connected the words with the last word I thought of, sometimes found a rhyming word. ",
1325,"I tried to imagine things then once I got the word in my head, then I would type it down and then I would ""branch out"" on the surrounding things that it would be accompanied by in the real world. For instance, if I said lake, then there are rocks around lakes, and trees around the rock, etc.",
1326,Thinking of connecting words then switching to a different subject,
1327,"Thinking of one topic and listing words associated with that, items currently surrounding me",

1334,I paid absolute attention to my environments.,

1350,I just looked around and then followed what my brain associated with the words.,
