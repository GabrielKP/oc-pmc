1229,I didn't feel any differences,
1230,After I did feel like I was tending to start to think of negative words or at least words that were popping into my head that were negative after reading the story.,
1231,I didn't feel like I could look around the room. I felt like I had to keep my mind focused on one thing (my keyboard) after reading that passage. I wasn't too disturbed by it but my mind was still trying to process what I just read.,
1232,Before reading the story word came to mind more freely. It was difficult to erase the mental images from the story afterwards and come up with lots of words. ,

1243,I felt change beacuse i do number count word,
1244,easier the second tme,
1245,nice,
1246,Not much really to be honest. I guess I was thinking about the story I just read a bit but I'm not sure if it really changed how I choose what words I did. Maybe more grim words came to mind but not sure.,
1247,Hoping it wouldn't last as long.,
1248,Nothing special,

1262,I didn't notice any differences. ,
1263,"The first time I played, I was primarily naming objects in my basement where I work, as well as concepts and items related to those objects.

1265,No differences - ,

1271,I recognize that some of the words that I chose after reading the story were in response to the story read.,
1272,before i was thinking of objects around me and after i was thinking of the story ,
1273,"The main difference i felt playing the word chain game after, versus before, reading the story was having an idea of what i wanted to think/write about. I had the story as a baseline for my initial words, and as i thought deeply on the story i just typed random words that came up. For example, my words contained casket, little, girl, apathy, criminal, mother, etc. Before the short story, I had just come up with words at random and by looking around my room.",

1276,"Some words I thought of when they were pertinent to the story, like dirt, sand, water, things like that.

1278,I was a bit more hungry.,

1323,,
1324,"I know that some of the words I chose were based on the topics discussed in the story, because it was so fresh in my mind. ",
1325,The second part seemed a lot more vivid and it was a lot harder to come up with more original words. I also kept thinking of the words in the story which greatly influenced the words I was thinking of. It kept me stuck in the story setting and I tried hard to think of other settings but it was just going back to the story setting and what I pictured while reading the story with Claire.,

1340,My thoughts were darker and more violent,
1341,I felt that is was easier on the after part. For some reason I was thinking about the creepy story and how the men just sat there drinking and doing nothing after they saw the body of the little girl. I was also thinking how could Claire be with someone like her husband and his trashy friends. I think I was stuck on those to elements of the story.,

1356,"I felt that words came to be a bit faster after reading, but a lot of them were words I used in the first round.",
