1094,"Since the story was certainly a gloomy one, it no doubt probably negatively influenced my mood a bit and I do feel like I came up with more negative words in the word chain game as a result. Starting with words about scary stories, moving into horror movies, then going in a number of different directions, but ultimately with I think more negative words coming up than had during the first instance of playing the game.  I didn't use any different strategy or approach to playing the word chain game the second time, but I just felt like more negative words were coming to mind than positive words, because the story had been a depressing one and so it was harder to think of positive words after reading that.  At the same time, of course each word was influenced primarily by the word that came before it, most significantly, but I do think the gloomy nature of the story also influenced the words, and the words would have a lot more positive if the story had been a positive uplifting one where no one had died.","emotion,lingering"
