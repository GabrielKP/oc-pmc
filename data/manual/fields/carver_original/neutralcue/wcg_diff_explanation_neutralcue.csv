1000,I felt more free to think of words.,
1001,"I actively tried to avoid using words directly associated with the story whereas before, I was freely playing the word game without interference or worry. ",
1002,"initially, word choices were heavily influenced by the text",
1003,change in mood,
1005,I could feel my mood changing with where the words took me. Words with negative associations had a negative impact on my mood and vice versa.,
1006,"Initially, i used words that i relate to myself, but in the second round, i related the words to what i'd read",
1007,"I found the chain slightly easier the second time, maybe that's just down to practice?",
1009,I became more tense because of the story's tone.,
1010,I think i was trying to be quicker the second time ,
1012,I felt connected to the story but fatigued by the activities. ,
1013,i felt a sense of randomness in each task but the story peaked curiosity towards the end although the beginning did confuse me ,
1015,I was trying to control my thoughts or perhaps finding it harder to control my thoughts. Carrying out the task immediately after such a vivid piece of writing and such strong suggestions was certainly intruding into my free thinking,
1016,"my mind was clear but after reading it was fixated on the scenes from the text. Whenever I tried to think of other word other than from the text, I got blocked. ",
1017,"The emotions and memory of the text prior to the second chain game gave more connection to each word as they come to mind. The first chain game felt lacking in any meaning - each word was just an association of the previous word, whereas the second game words felt imbued with an unintentional emotional relationship between each word as they progressed.",
1020,"I felt intrigued by what I read and it definitely peaked my interest. The experience for me was that it is a story that I am reading and just trying to remember as much of the text as I possibly can. Hence, the reason why I did not feel emotionally involved in the story. For me it was a matter of facts I neede to remember.",
1021,It became boring as it was a repetition of the previous task.,
1022,The second time I felt my mind go blank a bit more often and sometimes struggled to have a word follow on from the previous. I think because in the second round the words didn't jump from subject to subject quite as often.,
1023,less focused my mind felt more like it was a series of images,
1024,what i wrote previously,
1026,The second time I took more time thinking of the next word as I realised I had longer than I had initially thought,
1027,Easier to find words the second time as was based on the text just read and the emotional response produced by it,
1028,i felt spaced out a bit coming up with words ,
1030,"I felt more confused in the sense that I wanted to know how the story ended, and this preoccupied my mind.",
1031,It felt like going back to the word game after reading the story was more boring and uninteresting,
1032,"I felt more motivated to think of words and everything came a lot easier to my mind. In the first word game, I struggled to think of words and nothing was really coming to mind, but the text opened my mind to different ways of interpreting things, usually those beyond a base level so I wouldn't just think 'water' about the word 'river' but rather what could happen in a river, like fishing or murder.",
1033,i enjoyed it,
1034,I used more of what was in the passage but still managed to incorporate words from my first word chain,
1035,I used slightly more morbid words as the game went on.,
1036,"i think words came to me a little easier, but that was it ",
1037,I didn't notice any changes related to my emotions,
1038,"more sad, less apathetic",
1039,It was more difficult the second time round but this is possibly just because I'd done the word chain game once before and it was no longer new.  It was more difficult but rather because I didn't want to repeat things from the first word chain game rather than to do with the text that I'd read.,
1040,N.A,
1041,I didn't really experience much change. Maybe the mood of words changed by saying murder but thats it ,
1042,i thought that i was suppposed to think of words that were related to the story,
1044,,
1046,i significantly felt a change in my emotions and how i became somewhat attached to the word chain game more than i expected.,
1047,I was conscious of not linking the game answers to the text,
1048,a bit of a brain exercise perhaps,
1049,The I felt it more difficult to think of words in the second word game as my mind kept wondering to the text,
1050,When I searched my mind I felt as if the environment was changed. Different images and feelings came to mind.,
1051,The changes were from the emotional connection to the text i read to the choice of words i used,
1052,I do not feel I changed my thought processes or experiences whilst playing the word chain game,
1053,I was just thinking about what I wrote,
1055,the text caught my attention and made me engage more with the task,
1056,I felt more sad after reading the text - more serious tone. ,
1057,"As it went on a bit the word chains became tiring and I had to dig in to keep going, you sometimes almost came to a dead end where words didn't come too freely.",
1058,The text I read doesn't feel complete. I want to know more about what happened to Claire and Stuart after. I feel invested in them. My thoughts feel darker and more deep. And I feel I still don't trust Stuart in general and want to know if my instincts are correct.,
1060,My overall mood wasn't affected but I felt that I was almost writing in the same vein as the text that was read. Not continuing the story but more keeping in theme with the type of vocabulary. I did become aware of how negative some of the words were so did started to write more positive ones but that were associated with the previous words.,
1061,just a little harder to think of words,
1062,I didn't have man changes. I thought both word games were very similar,
1063,barely any changes ,
1066,just wanted to know how it ended.,
1067,,
1068,"Because I had just concentrated on a text the themes were still in my head, I believe my first word was murder because of this text.",
1069,"I felt emotionally involved in the story and could relate to it on certain aspects. the word chain game reflected the combination of the story and my relating to the story, specifically much more dark and fearful.",
1070,I felt no change in my feelings or emotions as it was just a text and had no impact in my daily life,
1071,Just a general feeling that the world is a bad place really - frightening and alien.  It made me wonder how well we know each other and things like that.,
1072,none,
1073,"When I started the experiment, I was in a neutral mood, my focus was just to get the experiment over with, while reading the text I became more intrigued and, to be honest, my hate or rather fear of the male gender grew significantly. ",
1074,I did find myself lingering a little at some points because it was harder to think of associated words but on the most part the words did come to my mind quicker,
1075,I felt that wile reading the story they should have gone straight to the police and not touched the body I cant think of anything else at the moment,
1077,"See previous answer. It was mostly the feeling and sense of unease that lingered. I had been in a relaxed, happy mood initially, but as I read the text, it became more sinister and darker. I felt less relaxed and more pensive",
1078,"Words that came to mind were directly influenced by the story and its content, of a darker tone. Word chain task more boring/tiring 2nd time as I had already done it once, same words kept coming to mind. ",
1079,"As previously stated, the words chosen were more in line with the text and more negative than before",
1080,Just more focused on the story in second game and trying to remember the themes for words,
1081,it was harder to come up with words after reading the text,
1082,"I felt more negative, thousgts of death and feeling uneasy",
1083,No specific changes felt other than having more of an idea how long the task would take to complete.,
1085,All is covered above.,
1086,uneasy and emotive.  reflected on relationship with spouse,
1087,"I definitely felt more tired and had to push harder to stay focused, but I'm not surprised by that. I often struggle to pay attention to things for extended periods.",
1088,as I already said annoyance after reading the text and then I quickly put my thoughts onto something else,
1089,thoughts seemed to be more dark after reading the text and therefore the start of the second word chain reflected that with more emotional words than the first word chain.,
1090,"I didn't notice any changes, only that I was slightly more tired as I usually read before going to bed",
1091,I just felt the word chain to be weird. It felt so random to sift that out of mind with no limitation.,
1094,"I would say I felt just slightly more tired/bored while doing it (only a 2) but that wasn't due to the story, I don't think, but just due to having already done it for 5 minutes previously.  I definitely felt that the story influenced my emotions, as I mentioned in the previous responses, because it was a very negative/depressing story, and so that no doubt influenced my mood (rated a 6), and probably to at least a fair degree the topics that came to mind (rated a 5, because that was also of course influenced by the word preceding it in each case). In thinking about it now, I would also say that it was more difficult to come up with words the second time (I rated this a 5), but I'm not sure if that's because of the story, or simply because I'd already done it, but I'm quite sure I didn't come up with as many words the second time. ",
1095,didnt feel any change,
1096,Worry,
1097,"I felt the emotions of the story, It was like It was happening in real life",
