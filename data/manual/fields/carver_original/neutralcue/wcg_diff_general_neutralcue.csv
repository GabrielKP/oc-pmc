1035,I did go for a more morbid terms.,
1036,"I didn't notice much difference, maybe it wasn't such a struggle to think of words. In game 1 there were a few moments i paused because i couldnt think of any words ",
1037,After reading the text words related to this story came to my mind more often,
1038,"more words with negative connotations appeared, I think",
1039,"it was slightly more difficult the second time to recall new events and stop my mind wandering back to what I'd already thought about in the first word chain round, I didn't want to just repeat the same things",

1061,none,
1062,I didn't really find an differences,
1063,no influence,
1066,after reading the text i had the story in my  head hence the words initally.,
1067,,
1068,There wasnt any,
1069,felt dark,
1070,there was no difference,
1071,I felt a little more downhearted the second time - I could really identify with Claire and that was rather depressing - so maybe my words and associations were more downbeat.,
1072,none,
1073,When I played it before I really felt like I was using random words but the second time I felt like my word choices were subconsciously influenced by the story.,

1075,just thought of the words in the text I just read and anything else that came to mind,
1077,None really,
1078,My words after reading the text were heavily influenced by the text I had just read as it was on my mind,

1086,more emotive - more visual imagery when coming up with words,
1087,"I was vaguely aware when submitting words which might have been mentioned in the text, or which I might associate with those featured in the text, but I don't feel like I was particularly influenced by the text when submitting words the second time round.",
1088,I felt a bit annoyed by the passage at the beginning of the second word game,
1089,the words I picked were more heavily related to the text and the emotions I felt whilst reading it as opposed to the first word chain ,
1090,It took longer to think of the next word ,
1091,No difference.,
1094,"Since the story was certainly a gloomy one, it no doubt probably negatively influenced my mood a bit and I do feel like I came up with more negative words in the word chain game as a result. Starting with words about scary stories, moving into horror movies, then going in a number of different directions, but ultimately with I think more negative words coming up than had during the first instance of playing the game.  I didn't use any different strategy or approach to playing the word chain game the second time, but I just felt like more negative words were coming to mind than positive words, because the story had been a depressing one and so it was harder to think of positive words after reading that.  At the same time, of course each word was influenced primarily by the word that came before it, most significantly, but I do think the gloomy nature of the story also influenced the words, and the words would have a lot more positive if the story had been a positive uplifting one where no one had died.",
1095,didnt feel different,
1096,Nothing changed for me,
1097,I was way more faster,
