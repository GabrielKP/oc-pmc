1093,I felt that I could play the word game better by just finishing the long story. I was more energized at playing the second-word game as opposed to the first. I couldn't stop referencing the story in the second half of the word game.,
1094,"I felt a change in the tone of my thoughts. They went from happy and nostalgic to brooding and anxious. I felt like the first story was about new beginnings, summer, friends, and the good old days. The second story felt like a broken marriage, suspicion, abuse, and unhappiness.

1107,no changes,
1108,,

1111,no changes,

1116,"In the first round of the game, it felt more like pure word association where it was just random, sometimes silly words floating around in my mind. I think my first word was ""pizza"" which is a pretty random and non-serious word. After reading the story, my mood was a little more serious and the themes of the story were in my mind, which I think is reflected in the words I came up with as they're maybe more serious and have a smaller range.",
1117,"There are a personal experiences, emotions, or changes involved in my responses",
1118,"While reading the second story, I felt a sense of dread which continued through the second story and the second word game",

1121,I feel like the biggest change was I had a harder time coming up with words having just played that game a few minutes earlier. ,
1122,There were certainly specific emotional changes I would feel when playing the word chain game. One such chain had to do with heat. Not until this chain started did I even notice that today is very hot and that I had been trying to beat the heat. So there was a respective response to this change that led me to think of the cooler things to hopefully get my mind and body back to a cooler overall temperature.,

1128,I felt my mind was in a darker place. I was chewing on the story and the clues laid during it.,
1129,"After reading the story, I felt sadness while playing the game which likely affected my chosen words. My train of thought was lingering on the story, so most of the words I used were related.

1134,I felt it was easier to come up with words in the second game. ,

1137,I didn't really feel any changes in the second word play game. I felt that it went by faster but that was it.,

1146,"I noticed that the words I chose followed my mood, at times, as well as my thought patterns. I also felt that the words kept coming through, even when I was worried I would not be able to come up with words fast enough. I also felt like the word game was taking longer and longer.",

1148,I felt more compelled to base the game around the stories,
1149,i didnt feel any changes,

1151,really none ,
1152,"I felt a sense of mystery, intrigue and curiosity about the story and was wanting to read more.",
1153,"I found myself coming back to similar words the second time which made me struggle to find others as I didn't really want to repeat and be boring, thus I think it took a little longer.",
1154,the only changes i experience was that it was easier to think of words because i thought about the words from the story,

1167,I noticed my general mood or thought process was a bit darker after reading the story.,
1168,i didn't per say feel any change but more on relief as i started the word game which is more interesting than the story i read,
1169,I for sure think the word game is easier after having read the stories. It helped to pull in some fresh ideas/material.,
1170,There may have been a change in topics while playing. The game felt less difficult in the second game. The game may have induced boredom. A change in thoughts while playing the game is possible but cannot recall.,
1171,"I found the second word chain game a little more difficult. The first game was easy, and non taxing. The second game, started with me feeling much more somber. I started off with a dark word, then more dark words that came from the story kept popping into my head. Also, for some reason I felt like I was reaching for words from the story rather than just freely typing first thing that popped into my head. ",

1180,the story didn't change the words in my second word chain game,
1181,"I only tried to change how I played in the second game, I tried to be as quick in picking words and not try to think too much. ",
1182,"The nature of the story was mysterious, and suspenseful with a little thriller. Therefore some of the selective words was chosen based off of that narrative. ",
1183,"Again, the biggest change for me was trying to keep any elements of the story out of my head during the word chain. I intentionally tried to keep any word that was featured in the story out of the word chain.",
1184,"I noticed that I was using a lot of words from the story I had read, eventually I started to struggle coming up with words id retained so then I just used random words.",
1185,"There were a lot more topics mentioned in the longer story, which made it much easier to come up with words. It was also easier to move from one topic to another because they were connected by the story.",
1186,I felt bored and that it was tedious to do that again.,
1187,"The second story, with Claire, I had a bit of an emotional and negative feeling. With the first word chain I was just thinking about word and a connection with the next word but after reading the story, the next word chain not only have me thinking about the sadness of the story but the sadness of the problems of society.",
1188,No change and I lot lots of fun playing the word game,
1189,I am tired and hungry it was a long story and task so far ,

1191,"The atmosphere of my mind space became moodier, sadder, and darker. ",
1192,There weren't any significant specific changes that I felt.,
1193,"Like i mentioned, really the first couple of words were influenced by what i read, and eventually when the topic seemed to cross again, the words I choose were relevant to the story. ",
1194,It was boring so my mine was wondering a bit,
1195,I felt that the story impacted my performance slightly,
1196,"At first the words came to me quicker for the second word game, just because there was so much content already on my mind. I also felt the words taking a darker direction than the first time I had done it. ",
1197,"felt relaxed, and calm",
1198,"I had a improvement in how I felt playing the word games because it took my mind off that dark, dreary story.",
1199,Again it was just a little harder to come up with words probably due to being tired from reading,
1200,I was thinking about death and murder more after the story but that is about it. Everything else felt pretty much the same as before reading the story. ,

1210,"I certainly found myself dwelling on what happened in the story and the themes therein - murder, fear of men, not really knowing who you know",
1211,,
1212,"I felt a change after the story, meaning the words i thought of were different but the emotion about the game was similar in that i actually enjoyed writing exactly what was coming to mind. ",
1213,"The story was creepy but I don't think I was affected by it too much. Mostly it was just a little easier to do the word game after reading the story because I'd just had a number of images in my mind that I could draw from. While I was reading the story, my reaction was that the writing was really good. I was trying to figure out what the time period was that it was set in.",
1214,"I noticed it was difficult to come up with words while playing the word chain game after reading the story, I'm not sure why though. ",
1215,"For both word games I just started with a word and came up with words similar to it. Example would be if I had done fries, I would have followed up with potatoes because they go together. ",
1216,made me go into a different mind set after reading the story,
1217,,
1218,I did not notice any specific changes that came to my mind while playing the word chain game.
