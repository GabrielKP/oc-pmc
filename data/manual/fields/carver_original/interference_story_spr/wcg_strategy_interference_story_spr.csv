1084,"Thinking of words that were similar to each other. For example, if I put an animal in the chain then I could follow up with another animal.",
1085,Objects around me or that I have interacted with recently. ,
1086,tried to think of things that were related in some way to the previous word that was used. ,

1093,looking around my room when I had no other thought in my head. thinking about short words that are easy to type.,
1094,"I would think about different parts of the story and write words associated with that part. Things like water, river, camping, dead, girl, etc. ",
1095,I just typed any objects that were physically nearby. ,
1096,tried remembering the nouns,
1097,I would repeat the first word in my head until coming up with a second word to type. ,
1098,"Trying to let words flow naturally, some of them from my physical surroundings. Typing blank when I couldn't think of a specific word. Rocking my head side to side. Closing my eyes.",
1099,i primarily used the strategy of looking at things around me and then the things that came to mind based on those,
1100,I didn't use any specific strategy.  I free associated.,
1101,"I had none, just stream of consciousness but word by word",
1102,none,
1103,"tried to be somewhat random, yet connected.",
1104,The strategy I used was to visualize the words and to type what I saw next.,

1111,Pick some words from the story,
1112,I tried to think of different words if I had already used them. I also tried to get my mind away from the darker words. I used words that sounded similar or began with the same letter. ,
1113,"None, i just wrote the first thing I thought of in relation to the current word",
1114,"Word relations, themes, alliterations, rhymes",
1115,"In round two, I used words related to one of the stories",
1116,"I just typed in whatever came up in my head. Sometimes after typing in a word, the next word I thought of was related in context/meaning (e.g., beach, shore, water) or sometimes because they sound alike.",
1117,"These strategies can vary depending on the rules and goals of the specific Word chain game being played, but they generally involve leveraging language skills, creativity, and cognitive flexibility to keep the chain going.   These strategies can vary depending on the rules and goals of the specific Word chain game being played, but they generally involve leveraging language skills, creativity, and cognitive flexibility to keep the chain going.     ",
1118,"Depending on the first word I thought of, I would think of more words that went with it and try to stay with a similar theme",
1119,I would just think about what is going on either in the moment and for the second reading I was focused on areas that I remember reading. ,
1120,taking in my surroundings and also using words i remembered from the passage,
1121,use a word starting with a letter i saw on my keyboard. ,
1122,"Some strategies I used while playing the word chain game would be to link certain words in a particular category, or words that that had temporal relationship. This was heightened after reading the story.",
1123,"I started by picking something I could see around me or something I had done or heard during the day. I then jumped to something related to that term, but not a close relation. (I tried to make more than one connecting jump between each pair of words.) I found myself mostly ending on nouns, but occasionally adjectives showed up. Rarely did I think of verbs or adverbs.",
1124,I mostly started with a category and named things that fit the category as well as things I knew that were in my room. I'm also a fast typer so it allows me to bounce of ideas more quickly in my head,
1125,nothing particular,
1126,"No strategy at all, just whatever came to mind. ",

1131,"Looking around at things in the room, thinking of the story, saying words that were related to each other",
1132,I was trying to think of different words instead of a sentence which was sort of hard.,
1133,Word association,
1134,looking at letters on my keyboard and thinking of words that start with a particular letter when i got stuck,
1135,I tried to start with something easy and keep the words relatively easy to play along with,
1136,Whatever came to mind,
1137,"I picked words that went with each other. Such as colors, or foods.",
1138,Just tried to think of words associated to the word i just used.,
1139,"I did not have any strategies, but when I would write one word it would sometimes make me think of something similar or at times, something that rhymed.",
1140,I usually try to write wrods.,
1141,USING THE SOUND,
1142,"I started with words that reminded me of the story, and then words that followed my chain of thoughts after that.",
1143,It would be weird to have a strategy for a game you can't win. I didn't want to repeat any words so I tried not to.,
1144,rhymes,
1145,"I didn't use any strategies. I just wrote the first word that came to mind each time I pressed ""enter"".",
1146,I just typed whatever words popped into my head after I entered each one.,

1152,I didn't have any strategies. I just typed whatever word came to my mind.,

1154,typed what came to mind,
1155,"For the first half of the first game I was trying to type unrelated words to avoid writing a sentence, so I would usually enter the second word that entered my mind. After that it was just whatever. Sometimes I typed a synonym of the previous word. Sometimes I typed a word related to the previous one via a common theme; e.g. Lord of the Rings. Sometimes I looked around me in my room and typed whatever I saw; e.g. spoon.  Sometimes during the first half of the first game I noticed my next word began with the same letter, but this was unconsciously. ",
1156,"I didn't have any strategy, I simply started with a random word and kept going",
1157,I just start to recite some poems in English and took the words from them.,
1158,no.. I go with the flow,

1160,I thought back to the story for key words that would help me input new words.,
1161,I used related words.,
1162,,
1163,While I was playing the word chain game the strategy I used was to imagine me walking out my house. As I have a very good idea of the surrounding area of my house.,
1164,trying to use words that start with a particular letter,
1165,I looked around the room to help me think of words when my mind went blank.,
1166,None at all just gussed off the top of my head.,

1170,Reciprocate words used in context to story or find words in various ways,
1171,I just typed the first word that popped into my head after looking at the previous word. I kept thinking about the story to help me keep the chain going. I visualized parts of the story to help me think of words. ,
1172,thinking mindlessly,
1173,i used some words in the story for the word chain and also thought of many scenarios in my mind,
1174,I memorized keywords,
1175,Thinking randomly about words,
1176,"Whenever I couldn't instantly think of a word I thought of the alphabet, and was able to come up with a word for a certain letter. I also thought of opposites for example: happy, sad.",
1177,I just listed off things that I see or like to do.,
1178,"I used opposite of words I had written, categories, adjectives, nouns and words I remembered from the story.",
1179,I used words from the story and what is around me.,
1180,words i remembered,
1181,Mostly just tried to focus and not delay or think too much about the word and let the next word form organically. ,
1182,Feelings and memories ,
1183,I just tried to free associate as much as possible,
1184,I tried using words from the story I had read that were fresh ,
1185,"Related topics, things in the room",
1186,Think of similarities,
1187,Word associations,
1188,I thought of things around the room and with one word I would try to branch into related words,
1189,no strategies just wrote what ever words I could ,
1190,I was using what was in my thoughts,
1191,I looked around the room or described words related to the previous words.,
1192,I'd think of a word and then another word that either completes it or continues it.,
1193,"first word that came to mind, when a word was mentioned. So it quickly came to finishing thoughts related to the word. ",
1194,pick a word and then use similar words,
1195,I used my surroundings to help come up with words,
1196,"I would pick a word, and then try to follow it with words that had some sort of connection in regards to it's meaning. When my brain blanked, I would pivot a bit and try to go a different direction with the chain.",
1197,most of the thing i came across in the reading,
1198,"I tried choosing words that sort of had a theme, like words about foods, or animals, etc.",
1199,associations with nouns,
1200,I didn't really use any strategy except one word would lead me to another and trying to avoid making a sentence. ,
1201,I used favorite drink and food to fill out the word chain game.,

1206,just whatever popped out at me on the keyboard,
1207,i thought of my surroundings and things i like doing ,

1209,i was replaying the story in my head,
1210,I looked at the letters on my keyboard and tried to come up with words beginning with those letters,
1211,"Well i just typed what came in mind, it was quite boring to be honest ",
1212,"I was just thinking of random words that first came to my mind, sometimes after a word i thought of another word very similar or in conjunction with the previous one.",
1213,A few of the words were things I can see right now. I didn't really have a strategy beyond that. I was just trying to make sure to not write a sentence. I probably was listing a lot of nouns so sometime I put in other parts of speech.,
1214,I tried my best to associate the words with the prior words and just kept going from there. ,
