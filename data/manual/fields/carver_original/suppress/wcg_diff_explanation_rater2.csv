1216,"After the story portion my mind felt more focused. I noticed less ""random"" thoughts in my brain. I felt like I had more control in limiting mental imagery after reading the story."
1005,Amazing  experience
1212,"During the word chain game, I was trying to determine if the study may have been testing vocabulary levels or syllables and began to become self-conscious as if my words may have been too simple since they aren't the words I would use writing. This made me begin to think of larger words."
1164,Engaging
1166,great focus
1205,had to think of strategy to think of words
1030,"I did not really have any changes, I just thought of words associated with one another. For the second, I started thinking about fitness items or activities and when it came to dance topics, I eventually moved into music."
1020,"I didn't feel any big change in my thoughts, except that I needed to stay more focused on finding a word to type in after reading the story."
1137,I felt a little disturbed and curious as to how the text ended but was able to focus on the word game.
1043,I felt closely to the instructions. To focus on words unrelated to food. And then focus on words unrelated to the story I had just read.
1081,I felt like I had a better grasp on the game because I had categories in my head beforehand this time. I should have thought about that the first time but I had never done this game before so I wasn't sure what to expect. 
1111,i felt like i had more practice in coming up with random words. it felt like a more natural activity
1053,i felt like i had to change all the topics after reading the story
1170,I felt more alert to come up with more words
1115,I felt more creative and more energized while playing for the 2nd time after reading the story.
1056,I felt no chance while between doing the first and second word games. I just focused on making sure the sets of words were different.
1027,I felt that coming up with words unrelated to the story was easier than coming up with words unrelated to food in general. I guess that I was thinking about the story as I listed the words to make sure I wasn't accidentally listing words related to the story.
1003,I felt that the game was harder. I felt this way because I had to think about not using certain words.
1128,I generally felt like I was able to move on from the story to complete the word chain.
1072,I just felt i need to stay in the present and think and type the words fast so i didnot think. Making the words rhyme more in the second round helped me to focus on the task.
1084,I just felt like it was somewhat easier to come up with words and easier to suppress my thoughts related to the story than it was the first round.
1142,"I just felt more able to actively think of new words, and my mind felt sharper after reading the story. I feel like I was able to think of more compared to the first round."
1021,i just focused on getting done
1059,I just have to remember the rules that I cannot mention the words from the story. Other than that i did not feel any emotion.
1063,I just tried to control my thoughts and focus on the parameters that was given.
1152,I just wanted to choose a more exciting chain of words.
1044,I only found it harder to try to avoid certain words because the story involved so many different elements. I had to put more thought into whether a word was ok to write. I had to consider and think about whether the word I was thinking of was relevant to the story.
1019,I think really the most specific change I thought about was trying to generate words that would be in categories far removed or not present in the story itself.
1126,"I tried hard not to think of the story. Hence, there is very little change in emotions."
1016,"I tried to focus in something less harmless, someone that I love and always bring me good thoughts"
1041,I wanted to stay on topic with my thoughts so I didn't change what I was typing
1150,i wanted to type words that related to the story
1067,"I was excited to ""create my own story"" this time using different words and a much different setting. I thought because some of the words I used were in the previous story it had been generated for me based on the words used. I wanted to see what outcome would come from the new words I put. I was excited to see it darn!"
1144,I was focused on not using keywords from the story.
1037,I was more mindful 
1093,I was motivated to think of new words for the second word chain game.
1130,I was thinking about words that went with the story 
1134,I was trying not to repeat words from the first game but I was able to suppress the story well
1106,I was trying to think of new words.
1057,"It was a bit harder to come up with words that didnt connect to the story...i had to try to think of more like...happy words i guess because the story was so solemn and difficult of a topic. I wasnt bored though, i liked the challenge."
1022,it was a very intense short story
1155,It was harder to think of things unrelated to the topic I was supposed to be avoiding in the second game. It was harder to think of words in the second game.
1178,"On the first game I felt sort of limited because most of the words that I would think of were related to food, on the second game I felt more free with the words and felt like I successfully avoided any words in the story"
1219,"On the second word chain game, I tried to type words that I didn't type in the first round."
1147,"once i was allowed to think about food, it expanded my immediate ""word bank"" in my head"
1090,The changes I felt was my mind were lingering on the story and what comes next. It was so suspenseful and kept me on edge.
1138,The only change I had was an eagerness to do round 2 because the story was very interesting which woke my mind.
1006,The only change that I felt was that I needed to be more imaginative in coming up with topics for the word chain game after I read the story.
1065,"The only changes I felt were that I was thinking specifically about the story and trying not to type the words related to it.  It wasn't a change in emotions or in how I felt, just in my concentration and what I was thinking about."
1133,"the only specific change i felt was that it was a little bit harder in the second round because sometimes the first word that would come to my head when i went to go put a new one in, it was related to the story "
1108,"The second game felt easier. The story was interesting, but also got my brain going. So in a way it was easier to be more creative. I could find words related to my life (and not the story) more easily. "
1048,"The story definitely brought emotions of remorse, pity, suspense, etc. but as a fiction writer myself it was not difficult to see the story as just that. Thus, coming up with unrelated words was not difficult. "
1218,"The story likely explores themes of communication, trust and the consequences of unfounded suspicious on a relationship"
1199,Well the story was pretty heart breaking in that a young naked girl was found dead.  Also the fact that Claire mentions about a murder from her youth and childhood town.  Involving two brothers who cut off their victims head and placed the body by the river.
1120,word flowed easier as i understand the assingment the second time around. however words came that had sone attachment to the story and was likely because I have just saw and read them

1151,I definitely felt bored and frustrated.
1183,I did not really experience any changes in how I felt.  My mind was a bit elsewhere as I found the passages to be quite boring and marginal and uninteresting.  But that's just me.  Other than that it was fine.
1163,i felt bored and tired
1110,I felt increasingly uninterested toward the end.
1023,I felt less bored doing the word chain game after the story but I'm not sure why.
1085,"I felt less tired and less bored during the second word game, because I knew there was not another ten minute reading task with comprehension questions to follow.  Work tends to be easier when the longest and most difficult task has just been completed.  "
1214,I felt more tired  and sad on the second chain game then the first 
1139,"I felt myself a little more distracted by what i had read, it lingered"
1215,I got a hadache so I felt a bit off and found it hard to focus as a spell of sleep swept over me.
1200,i got tired when playing the word chain
1191,I was more bored the second time because I'd already done it once before and I was tired of hitting enter after every word/sentence.
1176,"I was more bored, but I don't know that it had anything to do with the story. It just isn't a very engaging exercise, and the though of doing it again wasn't exactly gunning my engine. "
1057,"It was a bit harder to come up with words that didnt connect to the story...i had to try to think of more like...happy words i guess because the story was so solemn and difficult of a topic. I wasnt bored though, i liked the challenge."
1092,It was much more difficult and I didn't get bored at all. Was mentally straining. 
1202,my boyfriend came in the room and starting going through my things. he was not being very gentle so i was  little distracted by that.
1122,Not many changes. Just the difference of intentionally/unintentionally thinking about the story throughout the game compared to how the first game went
1105,Really just an overarching malaise. Maybe a bit of a darker tone to my thoughts. Mostly I was pre-bored of doing three more minutes of the word thing.
1096,"The change was not very drastic, I was slightly distracted by the story on my second round of the word game."
1141,Well something had been bothering me and on my mind for part 1. I tried not to repeat it for part 2. It still bothers me but I was distracted by the story/not wanting to repeat myself too much.
1028,"While I felt words came easier in the second round, I still felt mentally distracted by the story and how it might end."

1047,I felt a change in my emotions as I went from Round 1 to Round 2 as I had the story on my mind. It was kind of throwing me off in the second word game because of that. I was trying to focus but it was kind of difficult with those lingering emotions of despair and questioning the ending. 
1137,I felt a little disturbed and curious as to how the text ended but was able to focus on the word game.
1097,I felt a slight change in my emotions in that I felt a bit more grim after reading the story. It also felt just slightly harder to come up with words.
1136,I felt I could type words related to food. I also felt the story creep into the back of my mind. I didn't think much about what emotions I felt.
1188,I felt like I was getting more stronger and emtoional connected to each display of words and text I read while getting a chance to actually type out some of them.
1038,I felt more depressed after reading the story and found it harder to come up with the words
1214,I felt more tired  and sad on the second chain game then the first 
1139,"I felt myself a little more distracted by what i had read, it lingered"
1175,I felt sad for the girl in the story and wanted to know how it ended. 
1089,I felt that the story was interesting but the activity went quickly and I did not feel my emotions change much.
1172,I felt the second round that it was a little heavier because I was thinking of the heavy and depressing content of the story.
1004,I was feeling some sadness but also wanted to know who the killer was and if they were previously mentioned in the story.
1094,"I was more willing to think about living things during the second round for some reason; not sure why, perhaps it's due to the discussion of lives lost"
1029,"I was upset with you, the person who created this survey, for subjecting us unwarned to such vulgar material."
1050,My emotions more heightened in the second round
1002,"My emotions were much higher, and a lot more words were coming to mind that I had to avoid"
1096,"The change was not very drastic, I was slightly distracted by the story on my second round of the word game."

1028,"While I felt words came easier in the second round, I still felt mentally distracted by the story and how it might end."
1061,"With the first word game you asked me to avoid foods. This was easy because there wasn't really anything drawing me in that direction. However, the second time I had to avoid thoughts related to the story. In reading the story, there was a more visceral, emotional experience. Personally, my experiential memory isn't great in the long-term, but in the short-term it's very overpowering. For instance, my favorite time when watching a show is for the hour or so afterward, because it's so fresh in my mind that I'm able to remain in the emotional experience. Though, for the sake of this game, that was a big weakness. My thoughts were very much drawn back to the story with each passing idea."
