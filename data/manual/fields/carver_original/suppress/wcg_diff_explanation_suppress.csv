1000,feelings didn't change but had to isolate and cordon off the story in my head,
1001,"I didn't feel any change, it was pretty normal and easy to finish the task after reading the story.",
1002,"My emotions were much higher, and a lot more words were coming to mind that I had to avoid",
1003,I felt that the game was harder. I felt this way because I had to think about not using certain words.,
1004,I was feeling some sadness but also wanted to know who the killer was and if they were previously mentioned in the story.,
1005,Amazing  experience,
1006,The only change that I felt was that I needed to be more imaginative in coming up with topics for the word chain game after I read the story.,
1007,none.,
1008,I kept the same pattern where I just tried to keep the topics about food and the story out of my head.,
1009,"Since the story was about a young girl who drowned, I naturally thought of my Joshua.",
1010,I wanted to know what happened next but focused on the word chain game instead.,
1011,"Again, I was just glad I could talk about how hungry I was.",
1012,Changes in the words that did come to mind and an increase in difficulty in trying to come up with new words.,
1013,I did not really feel changes. ,
1014,"just a different mindset than earlier, more severe, due to the dramatic content of the text",
1015,"I thought it was easier, in a way, to ""not think of the story"" than it was to ""not think of food,"" because the story is a more abstract entity. A foodstuff is obviously a foodstuff. It was easier for me to not write ""Claire"" than it was to not write ""melon.""",
1016,"I tried to focus in something less harmless, someone that I love and always bring me good thoughts",
1017,The only real change was that being able to use food words made it easier.,
1018,no real changes,
1019,I think really the most specific change I thought about was trying to generate words that would be in categories far removed or not present in the story itself.,
1020,"I didn't feel any big change in my thoughts, except that I needed to stay more focused on finding a word to type in after reading the story.",
1021,i just focused on getting done,
1022,it was a very intense short story,
1023,I felt less bored doing the word chain game after the story but I'm not sure why.,
1024,"I only felt one change which was me thinking of the story during the second word game. During the first word game, it felt normal.",
1025,"I didn't feel any specific changes. The word game was not at all related to the story, so it made no difference.",
1026,"I did not experience any changes, but I forgot what I was doing during the second round of word chain. ",
1027,I felt that coming up with words unrelated to the story was easier than coming up with words unrelated to food in general. I guess that I was thinking about the story as I listed the words to make sure I wasn't accidentally listing words related to the story.,
1028,"While I felt words came easier in the second round, I still felt mentally distracted by the story and how it might end.",
1029,"I was upset with you, the person who created this survey, for subjecting us unwarned to such vulgar material.",
1030,"I did not really have any changes, I just thought of words associated with one another. For the second, I started thinking about fitness items or activities and when it came to dance topics, I eventually moved into music.",
1031,,
1032,N/A ,
1033,thoughts of murder and death,
1034,I felt in game two the words I thought of were more somber.,
1035,No real specific changes. ,
1036,Words got finished in mind. I tried to stay away from the food and story i read.,
1037,I was more mindful ,
1038,I felt more depressed after reading the story and found it harder to come up with the words,
1039,I thought about how it could have ended especially with Claire suspecting her husband.,
1040,No changes,
1041,I wanted to stay on topic with my thoughts so I didn't change what I was typing,
1042,I felt a little pre-occupied the second time,
1043,I felt closely to the instructions. To focus on words unrelated to food. And then focus on words unrelated to the story I had just read.,
1044,I only found it harder to try to avoid certain words because the story involved so many different elements. I had to put more thought into whether a word was ok to write. I had to consider and think about whether the word I was thinking of was relevant to the story.,
1045,I felt that thinking of words was going to be a bit more tricky. The range of words related to the story is more broad than food.,
1046,can't really explain,
1047,I felt a change in my emotions as I went from Round 1 to Round 2 as I had the story on my mind. It was kind of throwing me off in the second word game because of that. I was trying to focus but it was kind of difficult with those lingering emotions of despair and questioning the ending. ,
1048,"The story definitely brought emotions of remorse, pity, suspense, etc. but as a fiction writer myself it was not difficult to see the story as just that. Thus, coming up with unrelated words was not difficult. ",
1049,I felt confused by the story. I felt happy that I got to write about food because I am hungry. I felt unsure why they waited to call the police.,
1050,My emotions more heightened in the second round,
1051,I felt I was slower and my brain was acting slower. I felt I was still kind of thinking about the text I read and I couldn't perform as good as the first part. ,
1052,This didn't occur for me,
1053,i felt like i had to change all the topics after reading the story,
1054,I have not feel any changes,
1055,I just did what I needed to do. I did each section separately ,
1056,I felt no chance while between doing the first and second word games. I just focused on making sure the sets of words were different.,
1057,"It was a bit harder to come up with words that didnt connect to the story...i had to try to think of more like...happy words i guess because the story was so solemn and difficult of a topic. I wasnt bored though, i liked the challenge.",
1058,,
1059,I just have to remember the rules that I cannot mention the words from the story. Other than that i did not feel any emotion.,
1060,I think the word chain game somehow became less important,
1061,"With the first word game you asked me to avoid foods. This was easy because there wasn't really anything drawing me in that direction. However, the second time I had to avoid thoughts related to the story. In reading the story, there was a more visceral, emotional experience. Personally, my experiential memory isn't great in the long-term, but in the short-term it's very overpowering. For instance, my favorite time when watching a show is for the hour or so afterward, because it's so fresh in my mind that I'm able to remain in the emotional experience. Though, for the sake of this game, that was a big weakness. My thoughts were very much drawn back to the story with each passing idea.",
1062,I noticed it was harding to avoid the topic of the story then avoiding the topic of food during the first word chain game. I found it a little more difficult to come up with words during the second word chain game since thoughts of the story popped up on my mind periodically.,
1063,I just tried to control my thoughts and focus on the parameters that was given.,
1064,I tried to think of different topics for round 2 than I had in round 1. I didn't feel any specific changes,
1065,"The only changes I felt were that I was thinking specifically about the story and trying not to type the words related to it.  It wasn't a change in emotions or in how I felt, just in my concentration and what I was thinking about.",
1066,The only change I felt was that the second time was a bit easier. It was easier because I could use food in the game. Thinking of different food made it more simple. That's the only change I can think of.,
1067,"I was excited to ""create my own story"" this time using different words and a much different setting. I thought because some of the words I used were in the previous story it had been generated for me based on the words used. I wanted to see what outcome would come from the new words I put. I was excited to see it darn!",
1068,It was easier for me to include food in my writing,
1069,I didn't feel any changes.,
1070,,
1071,I thought it would be harder to avoid mentioning words relating to the story but it's like after reading the sotry I became warmed up and so it was actually easier the second time around to list words. ,
1072,I just felt i need to stay in the present and think and type the words fast so i didnot think. Making the words rhyme more in the second round helped me to focus on the task.,
1073,,
1074,I felt a sense of one room closing and another opening up if that makes any sense. It was like a wall rose up and partitioned the two sections away from one another.,
1075,None ,
1076,"I felt more down, less motivated doing the second chain",
1077,"The topics that came to mind during the second round of the word game were mostly me wondering where the text came from that I read from, and if it was a book I could follow up and read afterwards. As far as the difficulty of coming up with words it was a little tough at first, but after I looked around and got an idea of where to begin, it was a little easier.",
1078,"I was very intentional with my thoughts, coming up with words rather than complete thoughts. I also was very focused in making sure I was catching myself when I'd think of food or parts of the story.",
1079,"The first time felt playful, but the second time it felt like an obligation.",
1080,it was just aot more challenging to not type words in the story. it was hard to turn my brain off and not think about the rest of the story. i gotta read that book now. thank you,
1081,I felt like I had a better grasp on the game because I had categories in my head beforehand this time. I should have thought about that the first time but I had never done this game before so I wasn't sure what to expect. ,
1082,"All I felt was a sense of wanting to know what happened and why. I could not think of other things clearly because of it. It was more slow, and made me think more because of it. ",
1083,I didn't really feel any changes.,
1084,I just felt like it was somewhat easier to come up with words and easier to suppress my thoughts related to the story than it was the first round.,
1085,"I felt less tired and less bored during the second word game, because I knew there was not another ten minute reading task with comprehension questions to follow.  Work tends to be easier when the longest and most difficult task has just been completed.  ",
1086,none,
1087,I thought about things that were familiar to me or that i've at least heard.,
1088,,
1089,I felt that the story was interesting but the activity went quickly and I did not feel my emotions change much.,
1090,The changes I felt was my mind were lingering on the story and what comes next. It was so suspenseful and kept me on edge.,
1091,"I felt that the game became more difficult because there were a lot of words that could be associated with different parts of the story. Also, I felt like my mood shifted due to the story and I was thinking more existentially. ",
1092,It was much more difficult and I didn't get bored at all. Was mentally straining. ,
1093,I was motivated to think of new words for the second word chain game.,
1094,"I was more willing to think about living things during the second round for some reason; not sure why, perhaps it's due to the discussion of lives lost",
1095,I did not really notice any changes,
1096,"The change was not very drastic, I was slightly distracted by the story on my second round of the word game.",
1097,I felt a slight change in my emotions in that I felt a bit more grim after reading the story. It also felt just slightly harder to come up with words.,
1098,,
1099,I didn't really notice a difference. ,
1100,I wasn't effected by the story just tried to not think about it,
1101,The story stressed me out so I thought of things that would stress me out more to stop thinking about it,
1102,,
1103,I thought this was an interesting experience,
1104,did not feel any changes,
1105,Really just an overarching malaise. Maybe a bit of a darker tone to my thoughts. Mostly I was pre-bored of doing three more minutes of the word thing.,
1106,I was trying to think of new words.,
1107,I felt no particular change,
1108,"The second game felt easier. The story was interesting, but also got my brain going. So in a way it was easier to be more creative. I could find words related to my life (and not the story) more easily. ",
1109,I didn't feel any changes.,
1110,I felt increasingly uninterested toward the end.,
1111,i felt like i had more practice in coming up with random words. it felt like a more natural activity,
1112,"If anything, maybe my ability to formulate words became easier, from the practice of the first round... but no changes in feelings",
1113,I enjoyed the word chain game in both instances. Both experiences were pretty similar,
1114,"I didn't feel the game was much harder, just more restrictive and took a bit of time to get into a groove of words that could be used. I did also wish the story hadn't cut off.",
1115,I felt more creative and more energized while playing for the 2nd time after reading the story.,
1116,It felt like words came with more difficulty in the second game because I was working harder to not think about the story,
1117,I was slightly aroused by the end of the story,
1118,I didn't feel any changes really,
1119,There was a moment of wishing the story would continue to its end but then I moved on to playing the game after the brief longing,
1120,word flowed easier as i understand the assingment the second time around. however words came that had sone attachment to the story and was likely because I have just saw and read them,
1121,The chain game made me hungry.,
1122,Not many changes. Just the difference of intentionally/unintentionally thinking about the story throughout the game compared to how the first game went,
1123,"As I mentioned before, occasionally a word would come up and I decided not to use it because I felt like it was related to the story but I don't feel like it was because of the story necessarily.  I just knew that it would be perceived as related.",
1124,"Food is a big broad category that I hadn't been thinking about when I did the first word chain game, so it was fairly easy to ignore although there was a bit of an element of thinking of it even though I knew I wasn't ""supposed"" to be. But the story got me invested in what was going to happen and it was much more difficult to put out of my mind and I had to think a bit harder about words to use in the game that didn't have an obvious connection to the story.",
1125,It was much easier to think of words after the story section but I did have more difficulty avoiding mentioning the story than I did avoiding mention of food initially ,
1126,"I tried hard not to think of the story. Hence, there is very little change in emotions.",
1127,"There wasn't much change, besides more focus on food.",
1128,I generally felt like I was able to move on from the story to complete the word chain.,
1129,,
1130,I was thinking about words that went with the story ,
1131,I felt more on edge and it was definitely harder to exclude the banned topic,
1132,"interesting study, I tried to keep my mind free of food and the text as much as possible while coming up with words.",
1133,"the only specific change i felt was that it was a little bit harder in the second round because sometimes the first word that would come to my head when i went to go put a new one in, it was related to the story ",
1134,I was trying not to repeat words from the first game but I was able to suppress the story well,
1135,"I only thought of a few words during the second phase that I had to remove, the biggest one being Church,. I removed that because I felt it tied into the story in a sense so I avoided it.",
1136,I felt I could type words related to food. I also felt the story creep into the back of my mind. I didn't think much about what emotions I felt.,
1137,I felt a little disturbed and curious as to how the text ended but was able to focus on the word game.,
1138,The only change I had was an eagerness to do round 2 because the story was very interesting which woke my mind.,
1139,"I felt myself a little more distracted by what i had read, it lingered",
1140,When playing the game nothing changed. ,
1141,Well something had been bothering me and on my mind for part 1. I tried not to repeat it for part 2. It still bothers me but I was distracted by the story/not wanting to repeat myself too much.,
1142,"I just felt more able to actively think of new words, and my mind felt sharper after reading the story. I feel like I was able to think of more compared to the first round.",
1143,In the second game I was probably mulling over the story and why people who write literature often write such unpleasant things.,
1144,I was focused on not using keywords from the story.,
1145,Nothing too specific changed in the word game. I was just more mindful on what words to pick.,
1146,"I felt a little stressed trying not to think of food, and a little stressed trying not to think of trees and forests and water",
1147,"once i was allowed to think about food, it expanded my immediate ""word bank"" in my head",
1148,My mind was so full of thought about the text that it made it more difficult to think of words.,
1149,I did not notice any specific changes,
1150,i wanted to type words that related to the story,
1151,I definitely felt bored and frustrated.,
1152,I just wanted to choose a more exciting chain of words.,
1153,The whole difference to me was the type of words i put before and after the reading. I think I didn't have any issue truly coming up with words.,
1154,Not too much of a change besides the topic we were suppose to block out during each game.,
1155,It was harder to think of things unrelated to the topic I was supposed to be avoiding in the second game. It was harder to think of words in the second game.,
1156,,
1157,there was no change in my mind,
1158,I didn't notice any changes,
1159,,
1160,no different changes,
1161,"The first word chain game was much easier than the first, because you did not have to read a long story and then try to come up with words unrelated to it.",
1162,It was just more difficult to avoid words associated with the story because I guess I was still thinking about it.,
1163,i felt bored and tired,
1164,Engaging,
1165,felt the same the whole study.,
1166,great focus,
1167,it wasnt any different,
1168,No changes,
1169,I think it was actually easier the second time because I'd already played it once. ,
1170,I felt more alert to come up with more words,
1171,It made it difficult to think of things because i was consumed with the story,
1172,I felt the second round that it was a little heavier because I was thinking of the heavy and depressing content of the story.,
1173,Nothing ,
1174,"Well, I did feel that I kept really long on the study. But it was fun reading the story.",
1175,I felt sad for the girl in the story and wanted to know how it ended. ,
1176,"I was more bored, but I don't know that it had anything to do with the story. It just isn't a very engaging exercise, and the though of doing it again wasn't exactly gunning my engine. ",
1177,I did not really feel much different after reading the story.,
1178,"On the first game I felt sort of limited because most of the words that I would think of were related to food, on the second game I felt more free with the words and felt like I successfully avoided any words in the story",
1179,The experience was worthwhile to have engaged in while answering and reading the text.,
1180,I did not feel any significant changes.,
1181,"It was not a bad experience, the story was definitely interesting. The word chain seemed to drag on longer than it said it would.",
1182,,
1183,I did not really experience any changes in how I felt.  My mind was a bit elsewhere as I found the passages to be quite boring and marginal and uninteresting.  But that's just me.  Other than that it was fine.,
1184,,
1185,I don't read much so it was exhausting.,
1186,It was easier to type words.,
1187,I felt good,
1188,I felt like I was getting more stronger and emtoional connected to each display of words and text I read while getting a chance to actually type out some of them.,
1189,i felt very intrigued by the story,
1190,No changes i felt at all.,
1191,I was more bored the second time because I'd already done it once before and I was tired of hitting enter after every word/sentence.,
1192,,
1193,It was a great experience.,
1194,Its a great experience ,
1195,It was more boring to play the word game the second time after reading the text because it was much more interesting than playing the game.,
1196,I had no different feeling.,
1197,"I was a bit more ""mentally fatigued"" the second time around and couldn't wait for that part of the experiment to be over.",
1198,NICE WORD MAKING,
1199,Well the story was pretty heart breaking in that a young naked girl was found dead.  Also the fact that Claire mentions about a murder from her youth and childhood town.  Involving two brothers who cut off their victims head and placed the body by the river.,
1200,i got tired when playing the word chain,
1201,I took a snack break before starting this word chain and wasn't aware I had to avoid thoughts of food on the first game! afterwards it was pretty solid of a study. thanks for making me participate!,
1202,my boyfriend came in the room and starting going through my things. he was not being very gentle so i was  little distracted by that.,
1203,I didn't feel any changes. I'm pretty good at suppressing things when I need to focus on a new task.,
1204,"after the text i was thinking water, hunting fishing all the stuff that was in the story ",
1205,had to think of strategy to think of words,
1206,"Nothing comes to mind, majority of the noticed change was emotion-related and the difficulty of thinking non-story-related words during the word chain.",
1207,"I didn't really feel many changes. I was easily able to put the story out of my head, and if anything it was a little easier to come up with words since I didn't have to worry about not including food items. ",
1208,The only change I felt was the shift in focus on words to use that would not relate to the text I previously read. I did not feel a shift in emotion after reading the text that would lead me to write drastically different words from before.,
1209,,
1210,There were no experiences rather than trying to recall some of the text I read to answer the ensuing questions.,
1211,It seemed a little easier since I could use food.,
1212,"During the word chain game, I was trying to determine if the study may have been testing vocabulary levels or syllables and began to become self-conscious as if my words may have been too simple since they aren't the words I would use writing. This made me begin to think of larger words.",
1213,The second time around it was much harder to come up with words because there were so many already used in the story.,
1214,I felt more tired  and sad on the second chain game then the first ,
1215,I got a hadache so I felt a bit off and found it hard to focus as a spell of sleep swept over me.,
1216,"After the story portion my mind felt more focused. I noticed less ""random"" thoughts in my brain. I felt like I had more control in limiting mental imagery after reading the story.",
1217,I felt much more somber. Like my mind and body were drained. ,
1218,"The story likely explores themes of communication, trust and the consequences of unfounded suspicious on a relationship",
1219,"On the second word chain game, I tried to type words that I didn't type in the first round.",
