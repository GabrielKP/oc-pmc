1000,"the 1st time, avoidence  the 2nd time, concentration on a ltetter",
1001,Both parts weren't any different in my opinion.,
1002,My words were much more evocative after,
1003,the second game was hard because I had to think of not using words related to the story that I was just thinking about,
1004,I was still thinking about the story during rd 2 of the word chain.,
1005,No difference                                                 ,
1006,"Before, I found it quite easy to avoid writing words about food or eating. After reading the text, I found the word game a bit harder because the story covered many topics and scenes and I couldn't mention any words related to any part of the story.",
1007,none. just that i could use food now,
1008,I felt more restricted when playing the second time,
1009,The words that were to be avoided were different.,
1010,It was difficult to not think about the things I was told not to think about.,
1011,relief after reading the text because I could include words about food,
1012,I felt the second round was harder because I was still thinking about the story,
1013,no difference,
1014,afterward there was more of an ominous feeling,
1015,"First, I made a couple of food references right off. Wasn't really intentional, but I thought it was funny. I was trying pretty hard not to think about the story. I allowed myself a couple of ""funnies"" to slip in this time (poodle, noodle, doodle, for anyone who gets the reference).",
1016,I felt less confident in my ability to keep the chain going.,
1017,I felt it was more difficult to suppress food words than words relating to the story,
1018,I could add more categories that included food,
1019,"if anything, I think the second time was a bit more challenging due to the larger range of possible words that could potentially relate to the story versus just ""food"" in the first time I had to generate the words",
1020,I used the same strategy except avoiding words related to different categories (food for game 1 and anything related to the story for game 2),
1021,none,
1022,i was slower after reading,
1023,I didn't really feel any differences though I felt I had to try harder to avoid certain words.,
1024,none,
1025,,
1026,I didn't experience any. ,
1027,I felt like avoiding words about the story was easier than avoiding food,
1028,I felt that the second round of typing words came easier and more naturally than they did in the first round.,
1029,I was very disturbed by the passage. You should have posted a disclaimer on the survey. Upsetting subject.,
1030,I did not feel any differences,
1031,It was harder to concentrate after reading the text,
1032,uuummm i do not feel i felt anh difference ,
1033,i had much more intrusive thoughts,
1034,I was much more aware of the words not to use from the story.,
1035,not much difference because the words I used in both chain game were almost the same and weren't related to the story nor food.,
1036,Thinking wide enough,
1037,I was a lot more mindful about the words I thought of. I also realized I named off some food items by accident in the first game. ,
1038,It was harder for me the second time around,
1039,harder to control my thoughts about the story ending,
1040,I wanted to write words having to do with crime and murder afterwards since it was top of mind.,
1041,,
1042,none,
1043,I felt I could not talk about food in the first round and in the last round I felt I could not talk about the story.,
1044,I was trying harder to not think of certain words.,
1045,"The second one felt way easier, there was less to think about.",
1046,none really,
1047,I felt a bit more sad as the story was strange and kind of heartbreaking so my mind was more on the story afterwards.,

1049,I didn't feel any differences just words I couldn't use,

1054,there were no differences I think,
1055,none,
1056,"I didn't feel any difference, but I was trying to think of different words than before.",
1057,It was hard both times because my mind kept trying to think OF WHAT I WAS NOT supposed to do! haha!,
1058,no difference,
1059,Nothing I just have to make sure that I dont mention words that are not related to the stor,
1060,I don't think I felt any different,
1061,"Not many differences. Only thing I can really pick out is how much more limited it was the second time. After reading the story, it was difficult coming up with words that didn't relate to it.",
1062,It was a bit harder to come up with words after reading the text due to my mind still being preoccupied and focused on the story that I just read.,
1063,"On one I try to avoid writing down anything related to food, and on the other I try to avoid writing down anything that related to the story.",
1064,I found it to be the same both times. It was fun for me,
1065,I just had something different to NOT focus on.  I was able to type food words the second time which made it easier.,
1066,the only difference was that I could type foods and it was a little easier,
1067,"I tried to make my own story with the words, so i wanted to make a story in the snow and a thriller where a baby gets kidnapped in the cold winter in the woods etc.",

1073,I didn't feel any differences other than the taboo topics,
1074,I felt a bit disoriented to be honest. It was hard trying to remember each section individually. I focused so much on the story the word chain game sort of slipped my mind.,
1075,First was normal nice topic and the second was about a murder story ,
1076,none,
1077,"It was hard to not think about the story, I wanted to know what happens next.",
1078,I questioned myself more when I was thinking up words. Is this word organic or did I get it from the story?,
1079,"The first one I was focused on not thinking of food, and the second time I was just trying to get the story out of my head.",
1080,just having to not talk about the story it was hard,
1081,I guess afterwards it was easier for me to concentrate because I had done it once before so I was more prepared?,
1082,"I was focused more on the story, so it kept coming back to mind.",
1083,I had no thoughts before the first game but I couldn't stop thinking about the story before doing the second game.,
1084,I actually felt like it was easier to control my thoughts after I read the text versus beforehand.,

1091,"I found it faster and easier to play the chain game before the story, and harder to play after. It took me longer to think of words not associated with the story. My mind was thinking of fishing related words and words about the news. I had to put more thought into coming up with different words.",
1092,"After the text was much harder. The story touched so many things that my mind strayed to, like water and fishing and daughters and camping. ",
1093,"I was more unsure in the first word chain game vs the second one. It was easier to come up with words in the second, although I ended up using food words.",

1121,The round 2 chain game made it more difficult because I just read the story so I had to think of more words not related to the story.,
