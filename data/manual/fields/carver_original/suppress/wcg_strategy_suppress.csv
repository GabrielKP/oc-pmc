1000,"1st time, avoid food 2nd time, concentrate on the letter c",

1002,"Associated words, rhyming",
1003,tried to list things around or near me,
1004,looked around my room,
1005,Mind,
1006,I tried to think about things that were completely unrelated to the topics I was told to avoid which were food and the story I just read.,
1007,I just tried to focus on keeping things away from the forbidden topic,
1008,Just tried to tie as many of the same things together.,
1009,Words familar and important to me.,
1010,I typed the first word that came to mind,
1011,"I thought about what i was doing before the study (what I was reading about, what I was talking about, etc.)",
1012,Thinking of objects around me and activities I've engaged in recently.,
1013,"no specific strategy, just think.",
1014,just keeping the disallowed topics from my mind,
1015,"Tried not to think about food, as instructed; tried not to think about the story, as instructed. Tried not to link words together in any coherent way, but rather just used what popped into my head.",
1016,Try to think a few moves ahead. Be on the lookout for patterns in the words,
1017,I looked at letters on my keyboard to come up with starting letters for the words,
1018,pick a category and go with it,
1019,"Tried to randomly produce words well outside of the constraints of what not to think about (i.e. - food, the story)",
1020,"I typed in groups of related words, one word each time.",
1021,i just let my brain wonder,
1022,tried to follow the rules and go fast,
1023,I looked at things around me and also tried to think of random words and words related to them.,
1024,none,
1025,No particular strategy. Just used words I know.,
1026,I don't know,
1027,I thought about what I had to do today and the things I do on a daily basis in general. I also thought about my surroundings and what's in the room.,
1028,"I didn't really have a strategy. I wrote a word and then thought of all the related words I could type, and then just kind of went with that process.",
1029,I didn't use any.,
1030,I thought of something around the room and thought of words that would associate with it,
1031,I would think of a place and type what I can associate with it,
1032,"close my eyes, think of something then type ",
1033,trail of thoughts,
1034,I jst loked around and branched off from those words,
1035,I was just looking around my surrounding and thinking of what the objects were.,
1036,Thinking wide,
1037,I just tried to think of random words that popped into my mind. Or I would rhyme words. Or I would think of certain themes and all of the words within that theme.  Or I would just look around my room to see what I could think of honestly. ,
1038,I tried to think of things that were connected ,
1039,no strategy,
1040,I was just looking around me and going from there.,
1041,Just tried to make the sentences flow in my mind,
1042,I used related words,
1043,simply thought of words that were aligned with the rules. They were close in nature many times.,
1044,I tried to think of words that were related to each other and not related to the content that I was asked to not think about. ,
1045,I avoided thinking of things that may have been also slightly correlated to what I was not supposed to think about.,
1046,tried to not think of the same words,
1047,Once I thought of a word I then tried to use words that were similar sounding to that word and then moved on to the next word.,
1048,,
1049,I looked out window and around me to come up with words I could use,
1050,"No strategy really, I just tried to keep my mind clear and choose words that I can pair with another word",

1052,selected a room and things in it,
1053,not think of food then the story,
1054,"no any strategies, I was just type the word than come to mind first",
1055,none,
1056,I focused on a set of related words at a time.,
1057,I just thought of the first words that came to mind as i was instructed honestly. ,
1058,no strategy,
1059,I try to enumerate words that are related to each other.,
1060,I didn't have one.,
1061,"It was quite difficult at times. You know how it is, as soon as you're trying to think of unique words your mind goes blank. I did my best by trying to pick out things nearby. Occasionally, I'd come up with a random word that just happened to pop into my mind. From these words I'd do a few different things, come up with similar words, or come up with a word that started with a letter in the previous word. Having an anchor like a specific starting letter made it easier to focus in on potential words.",
1062,I looked at things in my vicinity. I used words that were related to the previous word that I mentioned.,
1063,I just try to stay within the parameters that I was going.,
1064,I just let my mind wander between topics and thought of a bunch of words related to the current topic before moving on,
1065,Just thinking of random words and about my work,
1066,i looked around the room at different objects,

1070,thinking of words that were related to previous words ,
1071,I focused on what I wasn't supposed to say. ,
1072,Just words that came to topp of my head and some similar words or ryming,
1073,I have ADHD so random words pop into my head constantly,
1074,I was just naming what happened to come to mind. I also avoided what was asked of us during these sections of the study so I kept those rules in the back of my mind.,
1075,Just what I was thinking about ,
1076,thinking about things in my yard/house,
1077,Looking at my surroundings and going from there.,
1078,I looked outside out of the window in front of my desk,
1079,"I just followed from word to word, I didn't really chase themes.",
1080,none just words that came to thought,
1081,"I just thought of certain categories first. Then the second time I did the same thing but I did it alphabetically, like fruits starting with A, then I think I did animals... and whatever random words popped in my head. A few of them were food but that's because I have food right next to where I am and for the first part of the word chain I was looking at things around the room. ",
1082,I just tried to think of anything other than the prohibited topics they added.,
1083,I didn't have any strategies,
1084,"I didn't really use any strategies. I just tried to stay in the moment, but I didn't try too hard. I felt like trying too hard would cause the opposite effect.",

1087,"things i know, like or just popped into my head",

1089,nothing specific,
1090,I thought of random items close to me and some relation to it.,
1091,"Since the story was around murder and murder is sad, I tried to think about happy subjects and then let my mind wander from there to try to steer clear from words associated with the story.",
1092,I tried to keep my thinking very close to the word at hand so that I wouldn't stray close the the subjects I was told to avoid.,
1093,"I did not use any particular strategies, I just used words based off items in the room I am in.",
1094,"I tried thinking of a topic and then typed words related to it, then if I ran out I tried to think of words related to the last word I submitted.",
1095,looked around the room i was in and started there.  tried to list many words in the same category before jumping to a new category,
1096,I was thinking of things in my everyday life,
1097,"Instead of focusing on the story or what I was told to avoid, I instead focus on what I see or do in my daily activities.",
