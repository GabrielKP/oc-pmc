1014,"I was emotionally vested, so even putting the story out of my mind, it was there. Words from the story kept popping into my head.",
1015,the seocnd game felt more easy time went by faster and it was easier for me to come up with words ,
1016,"I felt more tired and saddened by thinking of the character Claire. It also made me angry at the husband and his group of friends, so I was frustrated and irritated when doing the second word chain. ",
1017,"After reading the story, I noticed that many of the words and topics that came to mind while playing the word chain game were heavily associated with the story.",
1018,the chain game went form a simple put what i could think of to a way i could more put how i was feeling in it,
1019,"After the story, I felt more solemn, a little more tired, and not bored at all. It was easy to come up with words versus before the story when it was a little more challenging. ",
1020,"I felt more connected to the story I was writing and it certainly had more of a theme than the first word chain. I could also picture what I was writing as I was typing and could also anticipate more of what I was about to write in advance. The story felt soft and somber compared to the first one I wrote, which was very random.",
1021,The story had no impact on the experience of the game or any of the above topics.,
1022,I was more engaged in the game. I was less bored.,
1023,"It was much easier for me to come up with words in the second round, I felt much more interested when playing, and my thoughts were more focused on the topics from the story. ",
1024,"I mostly felt like I really wanted to finish the story. Other than that, I did not feel any changes.",
1025,I FELT SAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STORY,
1026,I felt like the words that were coming to my mind were less positive than the words before I read the story.,
1027,It was a little difficult for me to focus on the story because my mind was trying to think of words for the word game. I couldn't recall some of the stuff that happened in the story because of this distraction. So my main focus got shifted to the word game instead of the story.,
1028,I just felt like writing a few words that were included in the story I read.,
1029,I didnt experaince many changes except the topics I were thinking of ,
1030,I just felt the same and thought about the story I read.,
1031,I just felt more comfortable about my strategies.,
1032,I think having just read the passage some of the words that I had just read were more top of mind than they were previously. This meant that when doing word recall I selected some words that came from the story in addition to words that just appeared in my mind. ,
1033,N/a,
1034,I felt much more tired and bored whilst playing the second game after the story. It was not very conducive to how I wanted to feel.,
1035,"I felt more negative emotions like fear and stress. It was easier to come up with words since the story was in my mind, so I would just type out words related to the story. The topics that came to mind were more dark and morbid since the story dealt with death. I was less tired and bored after the story since the story woke me up and preoccupied my brain so that my mind was more active.",
1036,"I don't know that I felt any real change between the two word chain games. I think the second chain did have more to do with the story just because words that pertained to it came to my head because the story was fresh in my mind, but otherwise, I proceeded pretty much the same in both rounds.",
1037,I felt bored when reading the story but the word chain game made me active again,
1038,It was easier to do the game the second time. This was because I was not having to just think of words but had a theme when thinking back over the story.,
1039,I suppose I felt a little more melancholy after the story. It was easier to come up with words from the story.,
1040,i felt more intrigued,
1041,did not feel motivated to do the chain game,
1042,I felt kind of depressed in the second word game. I couldn't get the story out of my head at first.,
1043,"I didn't feel any change. But I guess, I was glad to do the word chain again because I thought the story was dumb and boring. ",
1044,Specific changes in priming me for violent words,
1045,"The imagery of the story stuck in my mind but I was trying to ignore it while playing the 2nd round of the word chain game, but it made me react slower because certain terms just kept coming to mind",
1046,I only felt change in topic for the second word game after I read the story. ,
1047,I felt like I was more mentally stimulated after reading the story. I may have had a bit more energy while playing the game the second time. It was somewhat easier to come up with words but wasn't a huge difference.,
1048,I felt a change of topics that came to mind as I was doing the chain game.  I kept thinking about the story but I had to try to clear my head and think of some other random words but the story kept coming back in my mind.  It was not easy to not think about the story.  ,
1049,"Everything was quite normal, the feeling and everything was just fine",
1050,Worried,
1051,,
1052,It was a pleasurable experience.,
1053,It really did not affect my word chain game other than I used water and natural words as one of my topics. ,
1054,There was a change in emotions,
1055,I got more bored and tired and had a harder time coming up with original words.,
1056,"I explained already, but definitely felt more creative.",
1057,I did not experience any changes. ,
1058,I felt maybe a couple words on teh second game were influenced from the story. ,
1059,I definitely felt that I had much more material to think about and my stream of consciousness was more directed in a certain train of thought rather than aimless in the first game. ,
1060,"I thought about the story. I thought about wanting to find out more about it, because I didn't really understand it all. Short stories are like that. It reminded me of college reading assignments. I think it made me choose longer words, and then I started choosing shorter ones because they were easier to make up. As I said I was looking at my keyboard for inspiration, trying not to type words related to the story or to each other. The game for me was to make up random words rather than do word association because I didn't want to accidentally type any sentences.",
1061,"My thoughts retained the imaginary aspect of the story for a few minutes upon starting the second round, but it was not that long. I did not dwell on the story. Partly too, because the story was not sequential in nature, it kind of bounced all over. ",
1062,I felt more sad and down.  I felt I was doing it but going through the motions.,
1063,"I felt like the tasks were easy, but I didn't put a lot of effort in committing the story in memory.",
1064,as i stated before i was thinking of the story so many of the words i chose were influenced by it and i felt bored in the second round because i would have rather been reading more,
1065,"I found myself deeper in thought when trying to come up with new words. I wanted to use words that were more ""meaningful""",
1066,"The story gripped me in its melancholic embrace, weaving tendrils of sadness around my heart. Each sentence etched a new layer of emotion, pulling me deeper into its poignant narrative until I was consumed by a profound sense of sorrow.",
1067,"Just a difference in words, because of topics that the story brought to mind.",
1068,i felt great because o had a better choice,
1069,I didn't feel much different after the word game because I didn't think too much about the story;,
1070,I noticed I used the word sad. I also used the word feelings. I wasnt thinking about the story intentionally but maybe those were real feeling I had after reading this story. ,
1071,I didn't feel any different. I thought about the dead girl and words associated with death more.,
1072,I felt that the words I selected after hearing the story and playing the second round tended to be of a darker and more ominous tone,
1073,"Again, I was so affected by the story, it was harder to think of words the second time. ",
1074,I did not feel any changes.  I confronted the task the same way each time.,
1075,I don't think the story changed much for me except that I might've been a little faster coming up with words. Thats probably just because my brain was working more than the first round because I was reading more.,
1076,I felt like had more of a rhythm going in the second round. It also seemed like my typing speed improved.,
1077,"There may have been a bit more of a ""connectedness"" after reading the story that influenced the word game.",
1078,"I didn't find too much changes after reading the story. However, I did think a lot more about the details in the story such as death, relationships, and murder.",
1079,"I felt more solemn and sad, maybe a little scared. I definitely noticed parts of the story sticking out in my mind.",
1080,Level of bodily tension. I felt more tense and stressed the second time.,
1081,I did not use any strategy while playing the game,
1082,"In the first round, I thought of words that I generally like. In the second round, it was definitely influenced by the story",
1083,I felt bored reading the stories.,
1084,"My emotions in the second round changed because I felt more emotionally charged after reading the story. I think a lot of what came to mind reminded me of our stark reality, as well, because these are things that happen, or types of things that happen - women are raped, killed, abused, lied to, etc., as a natural function of our society, and it's really difficult to reconcile with that. I think I felt more distracted, in part, due to this.",
1085,"I already could tell what you were doing.  Other than that, no changes were found",
1086,I found myself trying to piece the story together because it skipped all around.,
1087,Initially I felt stunned about reading a murder story but that eased with the distraction of the word chain game,
1088,Well it felt like i couldnt use the words i previously used and then i had thoughts about some parts of the story then it made me try to steer away from the parts of the story and i did. The story felt extremely long so i did get bored.,
1089,The only real noticeable change was how easy it was to come up with words for the word chain game. For whatever reason it just felt noticeably easier to come up with new words for it.,
1090,It was really great,
1091,I did feel some anxiety after the reading the passage. It was harder to concentrate because my mind wanted to think about what I had read. I just kept refocusing when I would get distracted.,
1092,"I felt a little more vulnerable in my space after reading the story.  The encounter on the highway seemed to spook me and brought up a past traumatic event for me.  I felt anxious at the beginning of the word game, but that anxiety passed as I finished the game.",
1093,"I was attentive and engaged so there was no change in how tired or bored I felt during the game. The questions captured the changes I felt well, there were not many changes except for the topics and slightly my emotions. I felt bad after reading the story, because of the mature topics.",
1094,I was for sure tired after I reading the story. I wasn't bored or no change in thoughts. It was not either easy or hard to come up with words. I think it was just I was tired. ,
1095,I did not notice specific changes.,
1096,"I wondered what happened next in the story, but quickly changed my thought as I didn't think the story was at all connected to the activity. ",
1097,When I did the second word game I thought more of words and themes from the story I read. The first word game I used words that I could think of from what was around me or happened in my life lately.,
1098,"Just what I've already said - an awareness that there might be words I should avoid, but it wasn't all that active. Also, I had cats jumping all over me in the first round and they'd settled by the second.",
1099,"So I feel like I have answered this question already, but I noticed that I was using words from the story and it annoyed me. I'm generally pretty good at compartmentalizing things, or so I thought. I try to focus on what is in front of me, and I sort of felt like the mood of the story was affecting me.",
1100,A feeling of sadness and loneliness. ,
1101,The only change I felt was that it was harder to come up with words,
1102,"I felt my entire mood/attitude change by the end of the story. I found myself more invested and wanting to know every detail i could from it. When I started the story i was hopeful, by the end all i could think about were the what ifs and all the questions I had.",
1103,I didn't feel any specific changes really in the words I chose. I did think about the story a few times.,
1104,I felt really indifferent and the experience was also inbetween good and bad,
1105,The only change of thoughts I had was about how I can come up with words that were different from the first round. In the first round I was listing off things in front of me but by the 2nd round I was running out of things so I just described textures and random similarities. ,
1106,My experience really wasnt that much different between the two games. I just had other words that came to mind.,
1107,I had different emotions wondering if I'm doing a good enough job. I feel anxious but excited to complete the task. It wasn't difficult to come over with words.,
1108,none at all the story was not close to my life,
1109,I felt more tense and anxious and tried to make a concerted effort to stay positive and say positive words.,
1110,I didn't really feel any changes,
1111,i had a different set of mental associations in mind,
1112,"I felt a mood change above all else. Before reading the story, I was in a neutral state of mind and thus wrote neutral words. After reading the story and having been immersed in it, the words I wrote and how I felt were drastically different, much darker and morbid and emotional. ",
1113,I felt more creative and more alert for some reason.,
1114,"Clarity, I wanted to provide as many different words as I could. So, once I began to pull words from the story, I would follow them with words that I associated with them; this enabled me to think of more words. So, the change that I felt was the confidence in which I could come up with many different words.",
1115,The story was really touching,
1116,The only change is that topics from the story kept on influencing my word decisions.,
1117,The dark tone of the story made me use darker words during the second word chain game.,
1118,As I said before. I felt like I wanted to use different words the second time around. Other than that I did it exactly the same way. I didn't really feel any noticeable shift in my emotions. I was just trying to type as many words as I could think of in the time given. I was completely focused on that.,
1119,"Really random word chains, 2nd round may have been more relatable",
1120,"I was thinking about the story at the beginning, and try to remember it, but later on I paid more attention at coming up with words that I can see in my surroundings.",
1121,just started feeling a bit impatience ,
1122,"i don't recall a specific change, but i did feel more somber, i guess? like just looking on the downwards part of life. ",
1123,"The words I were using were definitely more negative. I can't remember for sure, but I feel like I used a lot more words related to emotions and feelings than I did in the first round. I think the first round was more about objects, places, and people.",
1124,"I was interested in the story and got into it, so for the second word game, the words that I typed were mostly from experiences in the story",
1125,"My mind was more active after reading the story. Also, my mood was lower after reading the story.",
1126,"At the end of the first game, it had become boring. So when the second game started, I was a little anxious about three minutes of tedium. And I was trying not to think about the story.",
1127,I felt a little more melancholic after I finished reading the story. The themes in the story were very intense and a little morbid. I felt a little heavier and sadder after reading the story.,
1128,I didnt experience and changes really. Maybe a little more curiosity about the story but I tried to keep the story and the chain game separate in my mind.,
1129,I was definitely thinking about how the story would end. It just kept replaying in my mind. I also really wanted to know some of the missing information like who the guy was who pulled up to Claire and why did the guys leave the poor girl to sit in the water for days?,
1130,"After reading the story, I noticed many different changes. the changes I felt were pretty interesting. The new story offered new content, so I felt a distinct change in my mindset while reading each story. It felt quite different, such as exploring new content, viewing the new different personalities of the characters, and so on.",
1131,"I felt a bit of pressure to come up with new words I hadn't used in the first round. I tried hard to put the story out of my mind and focused on the word chain game only. Because I was using some effort to do this, the second round of the word chain game was a little more stressful than the first had been.",
1132,I was really focused on the story because i knew i would answer questions about it later in the study.,
1133,"I felt a little heavier because the story was elaborate, so my mind was more exhausted than the first time.  I also tried to use the story to think of more words.",
1134,,
1135,,
1136,"After the story, the word chain game made me reflect more on the theme of the story, which made me feel slightly anxious because of the subject matter. Additionally, there were more topic options at hand afterwards as I mentioned earlier due to the story, which made is significantly easier. There was no change in tiredness since the word game wasn't necessarily difficult in the first place, and three minutes isn't very long. I was less bored the second time around since I had the story to ruminate on while typing out my words.",
