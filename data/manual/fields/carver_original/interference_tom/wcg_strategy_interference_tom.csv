I didn't really have any strategy beyond that.  I guess I did try not to get stuck on the same exact thread of words though and intentionally skipped around rather than, for example, a string of rhyming words or a string of words that were all related.  I did the latter primarily because it seemed like the best way to avoid anything like a sentence.  ",

1417,"For the first game, I simply recalled some words close to my mind, and when I could not think of any more words off the top of my head, I simply looked around my surroundings, and typed out the words.
