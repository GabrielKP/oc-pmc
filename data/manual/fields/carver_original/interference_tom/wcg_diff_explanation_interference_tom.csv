1384,"I felt mildly disturbed after the story. Honestly the way the story was written was the weirdest to me. Because of how the text was presented I often had a hard time understanding who was talking and that made it even creepier. Though, I did not feel any more weird about the game itself, just about the story.",
1385,"I felt a bit tired playing the word game after reading the story. The first time around, it was easier, and I was less tired. The second time I had bouts of words and longer pauses between these bouts. ",
1386,,
1387,Change was just wanting to use or being drawn to darker words. It felt like I wanted to keep talking about sickness and death.,
1388,I felt that I was coming up with more words relating to the story but intentionally not using the words that I came up with because of the story.,
1389,I felt horrified by the story. I felt the word game was meaningless. But I also was able to do it faster the second time. I,
1390,"When I read above the statement on being bored, I realized that I was in fact less bored the second time!  That made me recall how long it seemed the first time when I played the game.  In fact, it was so long (boringish) that I wondered if I was doing something wrong.  The second time it FLEW past.  My mind may have been filled with the story and causing me trouble in my task, but the time didnt seem hard or slow...I wasnt bored!",
1391,I had a more grim feeling. I felt some sadness.,
1392,There were no changes in my thoughts.,
1393,I felt slightly more melancholy and at easy,
1394,I did not feel any change except I found it easier to play the game because I had done it before.,
1395,Darker thoughts and ideas of topics,
1396,The emotion was flowing - I was finding it hard to not create sentences because I found myself typing out my reactions to the story!,
1397,"Initially, I felt a little saddened that I couldn't get more of the story but after a minute I just focused on the word chain game.",
1398,"I went from being sort of left hanging on a cliffhanger since I did not read the end of the story, so having that feeling of incompletion and 'fiction anxiety' to a more general chaos thinking that I usually have. ",
1399,I think after reading I specifically felt like it was easier to come up with words. I also felt like I have been unintentionally picking violent words. I was noticing the influence the story had on my word choosing while playing the word chain game. During the second round I also noticed I mistyped a couple of times.,
1400,I felt like I was trying to figure out the ending to the story,
1401,I THINK IT WAS A LEARNING PROCESS AND I DID ENJOY IT AND THATS ALL I CAN SAY,
1402,"I felt myself thinking about the story and how it would end. Story related words were coming to mind, but I stopped myself from writing them all down. ",
1403,I did feel a little tired knowing how long I was going to have to type words and there was a solemness from what I had read but overall I didn't feel a lot of change. ,
1404,none change,
1405,i felt like my brain was at alert much more,
1406,Just a darker overall mindset. A little more sad and weirded out. ,
1407,"I felt like my mind was expanded; Calmer, less jittery, but more active when it came to latching onto related words. It was much easier the second time around. Topic-wise, I thought of more verbs than nouns. I felt more tired after the story, but not with regards to waking, just more calm.",
1408,I didn't feel anything. I really just wrote random words that came to my mind. Whatever came to mind I wrote. ,
1409,It felt easier to come up with words ,
1410,My emotions changed a bit because the story had me a bit confused. I was also a bit depressed by how the story unfolded. Coming up with words was a bit more challenging during the second time around because I didn't want to say the same word twice.,
1411,I felt like I couldn't think of as many words after reading the story as quickly as I could do before reading it. ,
1412,The 2nd round I was trying to remember words so it was slightly more difficult at times compared to the first round but the other hand there were moments it seemed like things were going rather quickly with the amount of words I was entering. I guess I could of felt a little more on edge trying to remember.,
1413,"I had a more focused feeling during the second word chain game. Throughout the day, your mind wanders and in the first one, I don't even know where I came up with 'monkey' - because it was so random, I found it more difficult to continue coming up with words to chain into it. During the second one, I found that having read the story, my mind was already honed into a more specific topic, and one that I'm quite passionate about. This may not have been the intended goal of the story and I may be a specific case, but the story found me thinking about the broader experience of women - both in relationships where there is a huge (physical/mental/aggression) imbalance, but also the ways that women move through the world and are expected to behave in general. So it was easier for me to complete the word chain task, but also a bit harder because it is a difficult experience to think about and string together.",
1414,I felt more objective with my approach the 2nd round because I had tried not to reuse any words from the previous round. This helped me focus more.,
1415,"I specifically felt front loaded with dark imagery immediately following the story. I then felt a shift mid game where I kind of ran out of dark steam, I recognized this change, and then intentionally doubled down on the macabre word associations. ",
1416,"The story was horrible, and very depressing and sad, not to mention scary. So of course that had an impact on me. I was focusing on playing the word chain game after reading the story, but my mood had changed and that influenced how I played the game the second time around.",
1417,"The most specific change that I felt after reading the story and playing the second part of the word chain game was unease. I felt uneasy after reading the story, mainly because there were still a lot of unanswered questions in my mind. Other than that, it was very easy for me to recall words, as opposed to the first time playing the game, and that was a big change. ",
1418,"My mood shifted, it was more heavy after reading the story",
1419,I did not experience a change in feelings,
1420,,
1421,I felt marginally less bored.,
1422,I noticed that after the story it was harder to focus on the word chain game but I didn't want to let it affect the words,
1423,,
1424,I think I explained it pretty well in my prior written response. The story seemed to influence only a few words towards the middle of the game. Then I was able to put the story out of my mind.,
1425,"I understand that this test was to see whether the words from reading a passage would subconsciously influence how my answers in the second chain game, but I don't feel like the story influenced my words because I only focused on getting as many words as fast a possible.",
1426,"I'm not one for detective/crime stories, so my interest in the story was more trying to remember details to which I may have to relate when answering questions about the story.  I also wasn't a fan of the writing style - so 1940/1950s machismo in Hemingway-like sentences - so that feeling was a bit of a distraction.  I was hoping that the passage would soon end the longer it went on!",
1427,"I was more excited to play the word chain game the first time. It was easy to think of random words. The second time, I felt distracted by thoughts of the story, and it was harder to focus. ",
1428,"No, there is no such kind of changes on my mind",
1429,i became more interested,
1430,My mind flowed easier around vocabulary so it became easier to think of more complex words versus the four/five letter words I used when I completed the word chain the first time around. It felt like reading the story warmed up my brain.,
1431,"no, everything is good",
1432,Nothing really,
1433,"I felt more pressure toy come up with words to type and not repeat myself, I have no advanced feelings on the task beyond this.",
1434,"I felt like it was slightly easier to come up with words during the word chain game the second time around, especially when I was exposed to a story.",
1435,I felt like I had more in my head the second time around. nut i also felt more bored,
1436,Definitely felt tired and more drained emotionally. I am using my standing desk and was standing throughout but eventually had to sit down.,
1437,"More thinking with my imagination, visually. I was seeing scenes. ",
1438,Nothing really changed.,
1439,"After reading the story, I noticed that I tended to focus on the overall plot of the story using specific words like boy, murder, river, water, etc. I found that it was easier to come up with words when associating related to the story than when free associating. After reading the story,  I felt a little more negative and so tried to do more positive associations.",
1440,I enjoyed partaking in this study. It was like a rollercoaster ride,
1441,no changes,
1442,"Transitioning from reading, the tendency was to use words that were just read or the images",
1443,"My mind did wander back to it repeatedly, sometimes words I couldn't use because they started to 'make a sentence'",
1444,CURIOUS AND INTEREST,
1445,"I suppose the changes were I was a little more focused on the story and how it played out. On the first chain, I didn't have this story on my mind so it was the only thing I thought of. Specifically, I felt like my mind going back to the story more the second time.",
1446,"I was still tired throughout the entirety of this experience, but I did gather that immersion from the story that lead me in a darker mood and putting me at interest in wanting to read a little more. It very much capture my attention reading this story as the characters had similar characteristics to some off of old movies I've watched.",
1447,"I felt my mind was more alert and focused after the story and the words I gave had more meaning and connection after. During the first game I was having trouble coming up with words, but the thoughts flowed easier after the story.",
1448,I felt that my emotions were mostly in control when I was playing the second word chain game. I felt like the story was lingering on my mind and I wanted to get to the conclusion. I became extremely invested into the story and that made thinking of words a little more difficult than the first round.,
1449,I felt that i has unanswered questions about Claire's husband and the person who was arrested and the man that was following claire to the funeral.,
1450,I felt a change in my focus. I was more focussed on the story in the beginning but quickly transitioned to the word chain task. I was able to shift attention rather effortlessly.,
1451,"The story was riveting, but as soon as I saw the word game pop back up I was engrossed in the game. The story was out of my mind in no time and I wanted to think of words. I guess I noticed a change from being riveted and somewhat disturbed by the story to experiencing no emotion at all as I tried to think of words. ",
1452,It felt good. I enjoyed the story a lot. I'm just not good with short term memory.,
1453,"It was a somber story with a bit of dread.  I was wishing I could read it all at once rather than bit by bit.  So I think a little frustration with some dread.  I felt sad for Claire, bewildered by Stuart and his friends.  ",
1454,"I felt slower, but maybe more confident? Like I said, I was still thinking about the story. I was wondering where the meandering story was going. I was thinking about how I didn't like Stuart. I thought he was going to do something to Claire.",
1455,"I just read the story, immersed myself a bit, and typed random words that came to mind, for the Word Chain game. I felt happy when I was immersed. I felt ''in the zone.''",
1456,"I got a sense that something was different but I can't put words to it.  Sorry, I know it's a useless response but I'm really not sure how to describe the impression I got.  It might just be because I did a word chain before but I felt like I was in a slightly different headspace for the second round.",
1457,I felt it was more difficult after reading the story. I notcied I was taking more time to answer.,
1458,I genuinely didn't notice any changes. I treated the tasks independently. Even though I found the story interesting and ironically some of it has been coming to my mind while answering these questions.,
1459,"I was tired trying to make sure that I wasn't making a sentence out of the words I put into the word chain game, but nothing that makes me want to go to sleep. I thought the game was easy enough, just trying to follow the rules. After awhile I did push the story out of my mind to focus on task about 30 seconds in.",
1460,"I could visualize driving in the car, hiking, the scenery, and the funeral. I also thought about breakfast and a kitchen. Probably a small influence on the words I came up with.",
1461,I don't think I was really aware of any changes going on in my brain while I was playing the second word chain game. I do think that some of the elements of the story did stay with me.,
1462,"I noticed a few of the words I came up with, like choices and consequences, seemed to be a little more in-depth than the first round. ",
1463,I just had a clear set of themes in my head so it was easier to come up with words; also as you can probably tell by my words I didn't like Stuart AT ALL so there were some changes in emotions as well,
1464,I didnt really feel a change,
1465,Just harder to concentrate on random words instead of wondering about how the story would end.,
1466,"I apologize, but I can't because I only played the game once for some reason.",
1467,"I was happy and alert before the study. Afterwards, I kept thinking about the girl they found. This made me feel sad and it kind of discouraged me.",
1468,Not sure what else to say. I'm not good at describing how I feel.,
1469,"Again, no specific changes in my way of thinking as I already consume dark criminal media daily for years.",
1470,I didn't feel a lot of changes. I mostly wanted to learn the ending of the story. I used some words from the story but didn't want to use too many. I then started thinking of other words. It was a neutral experience for the most part. I would like to know the ending of the story though. ,
1471,I did not feel any change,
1472,There was not much of a change except words related to the story were in my head. The story is still fresh in my head so I am still thinking about it.,
1473,,
1474,"I felt a little more pessimistic when inputting words, and couldn't help but pay attention to the way they might be interpreted.",
1475,I didn't necessarily feel any changes.,
1476,"They werent really significant changes, I was just more aware of how long 3 mins actually is when playing the word chain game and making sure I registered what was happening in the ""water near our house"" story. For some reason having to click through sentence by sentence makes it a lot harder to register and remember everything you read vs seeing it all in one page. ",
1477,I really enjoyed the entire experience. I did not experience any specific changes while playing the word game. Everything that I felt remained the same while completing the word chain game.,
1478,"I did feel a bit more engaged and less bored. My first time doing the word chain game, I felt bored and felt like it was never going to end. The second time, I felt engaged and like the words were flowing easier.",
1479,I think I was thrown off by the abrupt ending to the reading task and having to switch gears to the word chain exercise.,
1480,"There was a for sure mood shift, but really nothing too wild.",
1481,"I think I felt a bit affected by the story, as it was kind of interesting. But once I started the word chain game, I kind of put the story out of my head and was focused on the game, although thoughts of the story did slightly linger in my mind.",
1482,I was more involved in the story. I felt intrigued and wonder. I had a desire to want to understand the rest of the story. ,
1483,I started feeling mentally fatigued from reading and then trying to come up with words. I tried to not repeat words from the first game but did anyways.,
1484,The story did not change the way I played the game. It was easier for me to stick to themes when entering words in the game. ,
1485,I just had a little bit of an easier time since i just read a story,
1486,More than anything I just had a difficult time moving onto the second word task. I do not think my selected words resembled anything from the story but the story was definitely in my head and preoccupying my thoughts.,
1487,"I had a great time working on this project, it was amazing",
1488,"Mainly it was just easier for me to come up with words because i was thinking about the story. My emotions were also a bit different. I didnt feel as ""bored"" or ""strained"" coming up with words the second time",
1489,Definitely felt my mood shift after reading the passage. Im just starting my day so my first set of words were happy words full of hope and my second set of words were much more negative and sad.,
1490,"I would say that there were different topics that came to mind for sure, some of the words in the second word chain were reflective of the story that I had ready. Otherwise, I don't feel that I had a ton of changes. It was a bit more boring the second time, but more so because I had already done it once.",
1491,I put down darker words as the story went on. I guess it made me think darker words then. ,
1492,,
1493,"The first time I played the word chain game I was tired and bored about half way through and wanted it to be over. The second time, because I had source material to help draw words from, the words flowed more naturally out of me.",
1494,"Before the story, my mind was clear. During and after the story, I became interested in what was happening and wanted to understand why things were happening the way they were. I became a little confused since I did not know the outcome and was a bit saddened by what had happened.",
1495,it refreshed my memory.,
1496,I was enjoying the survey doing the story but it go a little redundant going from task to task. I was wanting to get done but tried my best to pay attention to details.,
1497,I just felt more curious about the ending of the story and if I was going to get a chance to read again after the word game portion finished.,
1498,I didn't feel changes. It was easy to compartmentalize the story and keep it apart ,
1499,,
1500,"I felt frustrated after reading the story because I wanted to know how it turned out. I also felt disgust in the character of the husband, so all of this effected the words I was choosing during the chain game. ",
1501,"I was already in a bad mood from my family so this experience just goes hand in hand with it, sad before sad now",
