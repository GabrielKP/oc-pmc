1385,"I think more words connected to the story came to mind after reading it, as before that, more words just from my everyday life and things around me would come to mind. ",lingering

1398,"I did feel some expectation of what I thought I might be expected to write and I didn't necessarily try to temper what my chain of thought words were based on that to some degree, but mostly I just went with whatever came up. ",no_effect
1399,"Before reading the story the word chain game made my brain feel a little like it was scrambling trying to come up with words, after reading it felt as though I had a little more influence in my word choices. ",concentrate

1401,they all appeared in their unique way,other
1402,"I remembered most of what I wrote the first time, so this time I used similar words, but used more words relating to the story that I just read. I was mindful to not have every word be related, but some words were influenced. ",lingering

1417,"The main difference I felt playing the word chain game after reading the story was that the words from the story were in the forefront of my mind. Words like ""body"", ""killer"", ""beer"", and other words that were featured heavily in the story made me more apt to type those in the word chain game immediately. In the first part of the game before I read the story, I simply just typed in random words or the words for things that were in my immediate surroundings.
